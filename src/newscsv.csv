1 hour ago,Monroe Evening News,"Evangelist, son of NFL player headlines Monroe mission","By Suzanne Nolan Wisler

Richard Lane was managing three thrift stores until some Bibles changed his course.

It was 2005, and the Detroit native was living in Missouri.

“(I was part of) an outreach effort to pass out Bibles on the streets of St. Louis, to invite people to come to our church and be a part of it,” recalled Lane. “I loved passing out the Bibles, and I wanted to do more to help others come to an understanding of faith and the love of God. I felt the calling to ‘say something’ as I was passing out the Bibles and began to simply talk about how good God was in my life.”

Thus began his ministry.

For the last 16 years, Lane has been “saying something” to tens of thousands of people during his parish missions and conferences. Next month, he’s coming to two Monroe Catholic churches.

Lane is not a priest. He’s a full-time evangelist, a Black Catholic, an Army veteran and the son of a former NFL cornerback. He entered the faith as an adult.

He speaks around the world and has a singular mission:

“Encourage others into a deeper relationship with Jesus,” said Lane, who’s back living in Detroit. “We must be willing to be the change we desire to see; we must be the living and visible examples of our faith.”

Last fall, Deacon Zaid Chabaan from Sts. John and Mary Churches learned about Lane and brought him virtually to juniors at St. Mary Catholic Central High School.

The students were captivated, said the deacon.

“He’s a normal guy. He’s very personable, very inviting and dynamic,” said Deacon Zaid. “He uses humor and knows how to relate. He challenges the audience. People see church and think ‘very dry, by-the-book.’ He brings life experience.""

Now, Deacon Zaid and Lorie Bronson are hoping Lane can bring healing to the people of Monroe.

“It’s been a tough year. People are kind of down. It’s a good year for a mission,” said Bronson, pastoral minister. “We’re pretty excited. His energy will be contagious.”

“There is a great necessity. People are feeling isolated, depressed, disconnected. There’s a need for a mission. Richard Lane will be able to speak and relate to the people,"" said Deacon Zaid, who came to Monroe in August and is studying for the Catholic priesthood.

It will be the first mission in seven years for St. Mary and St. John.

But, the venues shouldn’t mislead. This mission is for everyone, people of all faiths and those with no religion at all.

“We invited all in the community,” said Deacon Zaid. “People are looking for something, anything to lift them up. All are welcome to come and see.”

Lane agrees.

“I encourage anyone and everyone to come, especially the first day/evening. We have fun, smile, laugh, joke, but also get serious about telling the story of ‘who we are and whose we are,’” said Lane. “Don’t worry, we won’t lock the doors and make you say three Our Fathers and five Hail Marys to let you out.”

The mission is aimed to those in junior high school through adults. Admission is free, and registration is not required.

The only preparation is to pray, suggests Bronson.

“Ask, ‘What does God want to tell me through this messenger?'” she said.

The mission’s theme is inspired by Lent: “Open Wide Your Heart: You Have the Key!”

“Let’s open our hearts. God can fill them,” said Bronson.

“The world and nation we live in right now is in great need of change, for future generations. Come and experience an encounter with Jesus that will change your life forever,” said Lane.

At a time when the pandemic is still real, Deacon Zaid encourages people to turn out.

“Fear (like COVID) is also contagious. The vaccine (for fear) can be found in church. We are working to help you feel safe,” he said.

Social distancing, limited seating and sanitizing will be enforced. Participants must wear masks.

For those unable to attend in person, the mission will be livestreamed on the churches’ Facebook pages.

“We want people to feel something, feel different, feel inspired,” said Deacon Zaid. “It can bring peace and God’s love to them and offer hope for a troubled, fractured world. This is an opportunity to take advantage of what is offered now. You don’t have to go far to do this. There is something in our midst.”

Abolhassan Mirjalili, a senior emergency official in Iran's South Khorasan province, told the official news agency IRNA that Iran had sent 10 teams of firefighters to fight blaze, which was brought under control in six-and-a-half hours. No one was hurt and no there was no serious damage to property, he added.

The cause was unknown. Iran, which has some of the world's cheapest fuel prices due to heavy subsidies and the fall of its currency, has faced rampant fuel smuggling to neighboring countries.

2 hours ago,TSN,Former champion Dominick Cruz headlines UFC 259 prelims against Kenney on TSN,"On a star-studded night in Las Vegas, three title fights will headline UFC 259 as four champions compete on Saturday’s card at the UFC Apex.

Catch the UFC 259 Prelims LIVE at 8pm et/5pm pt on TSN4/5 and TSN Direct.

In the main event, light heavyweight champion Jan Blachowicz will make his first title defence against middleweight champion Israel Adesanya. In the co-main event, two-division champion Amanda Nunes puts the featherweight belt on the line against Megan Anderson. The third title fight on the card will see Petr Yan also make the first defence of his bantamweight crown as he faces Aljamain Sterling.

The prelims are also stacked with star power.

In the featured bout, former two-time bantamweight champion Dominick Cruz returns to the Octagon for the first time since last May to face Casey Kenney.

The former title holder lost to then-champion Henry Cejudo via second round TKO at UFC 249. Cejudo vacated the belt and retired following that victory.

Cruz’s loss to Cejudo came after three-and-a-half years away from action for various injuries after losing the bantamweight title to Cody Garbrandt at UFC 207.

Prior to those two losses, the 35-year-old was riding a 13-fight winning streak, including both title victories. He was forced to vacate the bantamweight belt in 2014 during an earlier spate of injuries.

After contesting for or defending the belt in his last four fights, Cruz faces Kenney, an unranked 29-year-old fighter trying to break into the upper echelon of the division.

Cruz says his position both as a commentator and former champion gives him perspective on his opponent and he will not be taking the unranked fighter lightly.

“When you’re an analyst the way I am, you know that anybody in the top-15 is within a year of being a champion,” Cruz told TSN. “Three fights, three or four fight tops is all you need to do to win, he’s already on a three-fight winning streak. If he wins three more fights in the next year, he’s in title contention. As somebody that’s been through the line and done what I’ve done, at one point in this sport I cleaned out the division, I’ve faced guys that were ranked 15 and within a year they’re ranked No. 2. There is no added motivation towards what the world sees these fighters as, because I know what each one of them is.”

Kenney’s three-fight winning streak has seen him earn wins over Louis Smolka, Heili Alateng and most recently Nathaniel Wood at UFC 254 last October.

The Portland, Indiana, native has won five of his six fights since joining the promotion, with his only loss coming at the hands of Merab Dvalishvili last February.

Also on the Prelims, four-time flyweight title challenger Joseph Benavidez will face Askar Askarov.

Benavidez is coming off back-to-back losses to Deiveson Figueiredo in vacant flyweight title fights. Figueiredo was ineligible to claim the title after the first bout due to missing weight.

The 36-year-old also dropped two championship bouts to Demetrious Johnson, including for the inaugural title at UFC 152 in Toronto.

Before his two most recent title fight losses, Benavidez had put together a three-fight winning streak with victories over Alex Perez, Dustin Ortiz and Jussier Formiga.

Heading into Saturday’s bout, the No. 2-ranked veteran of 17 UFC fights says his mind is only on his opponent and not on how many more times he’ll make the walk in his career.

“I really haven’t thought about that, just looking at the fight in front of me and it’s always to me about fighting the best and trying to be the best,” Benavidez told TSN. “Being the absolute best, I’ve fallen short of that, but that’s why this fight was so intriguing that I’m still getting to fight guys at the top like Askar Askarov.”

Askarov, the No. 3-ranked bantamweight, is an undefeated 12-0-1 in his professional MMA career.

The 28-year-old defeated Alexandre Pantoja via unanimous decision in his last outing in July of 2020.

He earned his first win in the UFC over Tim Elliott at UFC 246 after earning a draw in his promotional debut against Brandon Moreno.

2 hours ago,Bristol Herald Courier,Fewer jobs but better pay in proposed Richmond budget,"RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney is proposing to leave about 600 city jobs vacant to as part of a $770 million budget for Virginia's capital city.

The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports that the proposed budget unveiled Friday would include raises for those remaining on the payroll, though. In some cases, employees like social workers and code enforcement inspectors could see annual pay increase by $10,000 to $14,000.

Firefighters and police would also receive target pay increases.

Stoney said the pay increases come in response to a study that showed the city's workers are paid below average for municipal jobs.

The proposed budget for the fiscal year staring in July would be a 3.5% increase over the current year. But the number of funded positions in the general fund budget would decrease from about 3,700 to 3,100.

The city’s real estate tax rate would remain at $1.20 per $100 of assessed value.

The decision to move the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture in September 2019 was pitched as putting them closer to farmers in the nation's breadbasket, though much of their work involves advising members of Congress back in Washington. After the relocation was announced, President Donald Trump's chief of staff at the time, Mick Mulvaney, joked that moving the jobs to Kansas City was also ""a wonderful way to streamline government."" Tom Vilsack inherited a demoralized workforce at the two agencies when he took over as secretary of agriculture under President Joe Biden. With 235 vacancies between them, the agencies continued to hire during the pandemic and administration change, but they are putting out work that is smaller in scope and less frequent, causing some farmers to look elsewhere for data they rely on to run their operations. Among them is Vance Ehmke, who said that since the USDA relocations occurred, he has been paying a lot more attention to private market analysis and what private grain companies are doing. The information feeds his decisions on everything from whether to buy more land or a new tractor to whether to build more grain bins.

""Here, when we need really good, hard information, you are really starting to question groups like USDA, which before that had a sterling reputation,"" Ehmke said recently. ""But out in the country, people are worried about how good the information is now because those groups are operating at half capacity."" The relocation hollowed out years of specialized experience and delayed or scuttled some of the agencies' research and other work. Hiring at the Kansas City site remains well below the roughly 550 high-paying jobs local leaders had anticipated.

Farmers rely on the research to make decisions on a wide range of topics, from rural community planning to farming with climate change and volatile weather conditions, said Aaron Lehman, a farmer who is president of the Iowa Farmers Union.

The ERS examines issues including the rural economy, international trade, food safety and programs that provide food assistance to poor Americans. NIFA, meanwhile, provides grants for agricultural research and other farm services.

""It has gone in the wrong direction in general in terms of accuracy now,'' said Adrian Polansky, a farmer and former executive director of the USDA's Farm Service Agency office in Kansas during the Obama administration. ''Whether that was for sure based on that transition or whether it was the leadership in the department in terms of what the political goals may have been, I am not exactly sure. But it seems like there was less reliability."" Polansky said he looks to commercial sources of agricultural information to corroborate USDA data more often now than he did in the past. He said that even after the agencies fill their openings, it will take time to ""become fully impactful"" because research is a long-term endeavor.

''When you lose significant staff and significant institutional knowledge, there is just not a way that can't impact the product and information from USDA,'' he said. Dan O'Brien, a grain market specialist at Kansas State University Research and Extension, acknowledged that farmers have increasingly been questioning the reliability of the government's agricultural data over the past few years. However, he said those frustrations have dealt more with reports published by other USDA agencies, and that some farmers may be confusing them.

Laura Dodson, the union representative for ERS employees, said the relocation will affect the agency for another five years. It hasn't affected the accuracy of its reports, but it has reduced their scope and frequency.

Dozens of ERS reports have either come out late or not all, including reports on the organic food sector, antibiotic use in animal production, and hired farm workers and labor markets, among others, Dodson said. For example, a two-year research project on pollinators such as honeybees was shelved because the entire team working on it left the agency rather than move to Kansas City.

ERS published 37 reports in 2018, compared to 11 last year, Dodson said. Those figures don't include its monthly crop price and analysis reports, which have remained fairly steady despite the relocation and the pandemic. Agency employees also published 100 articles in academic journals related to their fields of study in 2018, but just 64 in 2020.

""We help make sure that food is produced safely, timely and responds to changes in the marketplace and changes to environmental sector,"" she said. ''And so if those become less effective because they are not being informed by good data and research, that will translate directly to how Americans receive their food."" Matt Herrick, a USDA spokesman, said in an email that he couldn't speak to the volume and variety of ERS reports and research under the Trump administration. ""However, when you lose more than half of your expert workforce, there is bound to be a noticeable effect,"" he added, noting that the USDA is focused on restoring employee confidence and morale.

Highlights | Scorecard | News

The relentless Indian spin cycle has left England a ragged shadow of the team that coasted to a 227-run win in the first Test, and it was fitting the series should end with Axar and Ravichandran Ashwin running amok, taking five wickets each at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Motera.

The third Test was a two-day shock to the tourists' senses, while England headed into day three of this latest match in Ahmedabad knowing it would take something special to stave off one final heavy beating.

Test newcomer Axar Patel and Ravichandran Ashwin have tortured the England batsmen in this series, and they were again the destroyers in a total of 135 all out, Axar with 5-48 and Ashwin taking 5-47 to nail down the win by an innings and 25 runs.

From 294-7 overnight in their first innings, leading by 89 runs, India scuppered English hopes of a quick burst through the tail as Washington Sundar and Axar led them to 365, at which point England finally took the three wickets they had been craving.

Here are the statistical highlights:

INDIA’S FOURTH BIGGEST WIN OVER ENGLAND

In a leaked email circulated to MinterEllison staff on Wednesday, Ms Kimmitt wrote that Peter Bartlett, a partner at MinterEllison and one of the country’s top defamation and media lawyers, had not advised the firm before taking a brief from Mr Porter. “The nature of this matter is clearly causing hurt to some of you, and it has certainly triggered hurt for me. I know that for many it may be a tough day, and I want to apologise for the pain you may be experiencing,” the email said. “The acceptance of this matter did not go through the firm’s due consultation or approval process.” Many of the firm’s 247 partners were stunned by the implication that the firm may have refused to take on Mr Porter, and that Mr Bartlett had acted without authority. Some have been openly questioning the judgment of Ms Kimmitt, who is not a lawyer but hails from Ernst & Young. “The firm, like most law firms, is still pretty old school and isn’t really on board with the CEO’s woke policies,” one staffer told Emerald City.

Here are your rugby headlines from Wales and beyond for Saturday, March 6.

Lions reject Australia's offer

The British and Irish Lions board has reportedly turned down Australia's offer to host this summer's series against South Africa.

The Lions are due to tour South Africa in July and August but the coronavirus, vaccine and spectator situation means the tour is fraught with complications.

The BBC report that after a meeting on Friday, it was decided that staging the tour in Australia - who have bid to host the series in January with the expectation they could have full-capacity stadiums - is not a viable option.

The saga is now set to rumble on into next week at least, with four options remaining on the table: a home ""tour"", a tour to South Africa with matches played behind closed doors, a postponement or cancellation.

Jonah Holmes: 'It's been frustrating watching Wales'

Five-cap Wales international Jonah Holmes has opened up about his frustration watching Wales during the Six Nations, admitting he needs to get a string of games together and hopefully take his next chance.

Dragons winger Holmes, 28 - who moved from Leicester Tigers to Wales last season - missed out on Six Nations squad selection due to injury but is now hoping a run of performances can earn a recall.

""It's been frustrating watching Wales but it happens, I just have to take it on the chin,"" he told the Western Telegraph.

""It's good to have players in your position doing well. It's hard to take sometimes but it ends up driving competition and making everybody a better player.

""I need to play regularly and show that I could be in the squad. I just need to play and hope that I take the next chance I get.""

Holmes has made nine appearances since heading to Wales for the 2019/2020 season, and knows he needs to do more.

""I've barely touched the ball and hopefully I can string some games together and do some running. It happens sometimes as a winger, there are just some games where you don't get much ball.

""You have to adapt your game to try and get your hands on the ball, and that's something I need to do in the next few weeks.""

WillGriff John sin-binned as Sale Sharks move to second in Premiership

Sale Sharks moved to second in the Gallagher Premiership table on Friday night after defeating Newcastle Falcons 31-16, even after Wales call-up WillGriff John was sin-binned.

The hosts led at the break thanks to tries from Marland Yarde and Lood de Jager, while Brett Connon's penalties got the Falcons off the mark.

Sale had WillGriff John, who was called up to Wales' Six Nations squad after Dillon Lewis was released through injury, sent to the sin-bin for a dangerous clear-out after the break before Joel Matavesi got the Falcons' only try.

The Sharks' win was confirmed late on when Simon Hammersley crossed over.

Sam Underhill hands England a fitness boost

Sam Underhill makes his comeback from a hip problem for Bath on Saturday to raise the prospect of him appearing in the final two rounds of England's Guinness Six Nations campaign.

The Gallagher Premiership clash with Exeter will be Underhill's first outing since sustaining the injury in January, forcing him to miss the Championship games against Scotland, Italy and Wales.

Jack Willis took his place in England's 28-man squad but the Wasps flanker sustained a serious knee injury against the Azzurri and is ruled out long term.

The vacancy created by Willis' absence has been filled by 19-year-old Leicester back-five forward George Martin and his spot would be under threat if Jones does opt to recall Underhill.

Adam Hastings banned for Scotland clashes against Ireland and Italy

Adam Hastings' Scotland return will be further delayed after he was handed a three-game ban for his red card against Leinster on Sunday.

Catching a high ball in the 37th minute of Glasgow Warriors' Guinness PRO14 fixture, an airborne Hastings raised his lead leg and his boot made contact with Cian Kelleher's face.

Referee Frank Murphy produced his red card following the TMO review and the disciplinary process concluded the incident merited a mid-range entry point.

Given the mitigating factors, including the player's acceptance of foul play, a 50 per cent reduction was applied to the default ban of six weeks, meaning Hastings will miss the next three meaningful games.

Scotland head coach Gregor Townsend had recalled the 24-year-old to his squad for the Six Nations match with France, which was scheduled for last weekend before a coronavirus outbreak in the French camp saw the fixture postponed.

Hastings has not played for his country since he sustained a shoulder injury in the 14-10 win over Wales in Llanelli back in October but returned to action with Glasgow against Ulster on February 19, before starting the Warriors' defeat to Leinster on Sunday.

Hastings, who will join Gloucester at the end of the season, will now be absent for Scotland's next two Six Nations fixtures against Ireland and Italy, with his ban due to end at midnight on March 21.

He could feature in the rearranged clash with France, which is being lined up for March 26, the PA news agency understands.","Here are your rugby headlines from Wales and beyond for Saturday, March 6.

Ballad Health was treating 70 COVID-positive inpatients at its hospitals Friday, including 15 in intensive care units and eight on ventilators. The total number of patients is down slightly compared to previous days, but Ballad has treated an average of 75 patients per day during the past week — slightly less than the 79-patient average reported last Friday.

Prior to Friday, new COVID admissions were running at twice the rate of discharges during the past week. On Friday, there were 11 discharges and six admissions.

Additionally, after a week where the region’s seven-day testing positivity rate was around 9%, it climbed back to 10.5% Friday. Tennessee’s average was 5.2%, according to the state board of health, while Virginia’s is 6.3%. The goal is less than 5% to limit community spread.

Much of the volume is occurring in Sullivan County, which reported an 11.8% positivity average and added an average of 32 new cases per day over the past 14 days — by far the most in the region. Sullivan reported 171 new cases during the past seven days, an average of 24.4 cases per day, with over 300 active cases.

The welterweight who reps Trenton, NJ headlines tonight on an RDR card in Feasterville, PA, which you can watch on Fightnight Live, debuted a pro on April 27, 2019. He fought seven times in ’19, going 6-1, dropping a six rounder to Paul Kroll. Bunch, now 21 years old, fought “just” five times in 2020, because COVID gummed up the works for everybody. So far in 2021, Bunch has gloved up three times, and he’s bested Dieumerci Nzau, Charlie Dubray and then, on Feb. 12, 14-28-3 Ariel Vasquez in Florida.

The young man goes where the fights are breaking out, so it’s back up East for the Saturday night main event, that you can watch on the streaming platform FloSports, which requires a moderate subscription fee. Fightnight Live is pleased to establish a connection to FloSports, a subscription sports broadcaster and streaming service, born in 2006, based in Austin, Texas.

I chatted with a chill Bunch, because he’d enjoyed his post weigh in chodown, on a pile of shrimp Alfredo.

Bunch (left) seems to be a guy on a run, with momentum, working in a very structured and contained frenzy. Trainer Chino Rivas, he tells me, is pretty much a godsend, because he so appreciates the amount of knowledge that he’s soaked up.

“This is our third fight or so, and man, I feel like everything’s improved, my speed, my power, the way I move, the way I think in the ring, the adjustments I makein there,” he stated.

“Not only physically, but mentally, too.”

That process, the sponging up of knowledge, he said, started on day one when he started with with Rivas.

The last two victims got stopped out in round one, but Shinard Bunch doesn’t sound like he’s gotten enamored with the quick dopamine hit that comes from the KO1 win.

“We don’t ever go in to make a quick hit, we just look for openings,” he said.

“And we don’t take anybody lightly. These opponents are in the ring for reason.”

Check out some Bunch, here he is taking care of things in his tenth pro fight:

Compare his progress, to how Shinard Bunch looked in his fourth pro tango, against Kevin Womack Jr. That face-off screened on Fightnight Live, on Oct. 4, 2019.

His Feasterville dancing partner in Feasterville, Krael, enters with a 17-17-3 record.

I can almost guarantee that with that record, he deserves to be better than .500. Krael gets invited to the party to put up a solid test, but he’s not being pushed as an A sider with a high ceiling. The 27 year old who was born in Hawaii, and has made Vegas his residence, last gloved up on Oct. 9, 2020. Top tier prospect Elvis Rodriguez stopped him out in round three of their scheduled eight.

“I’ve watched like four of his fights,” Bunch said. “He’s definitely a worthy opponent. He’s been known to last, throws a lot of punches, he can move. And will I be thinking of how other guys, like Rodriguez, beat him? No, definitely not, we will fight our fight. I’m not going in to impress anybody.”

Krael can expect a strong and confident foe, who is aggressive, who is going to stalk him, very patiently. He’ll need to be wary of both hands, Bunch has above average power. Punches might come at him straight, sweeping from the side, from underneath, or over the top, in a span of 10 seconds. Right hands to the body will probably score on Krael a good bit, and Krael shouldn’t expect that Bunch will get flustered.

Some back story; Shinard Bunch was raised by his mom, in Brooklyn, East NY. He picked up boxing young, after watching a Muhammad Ali DVD his mom bought, and worked with Zab Judah’s dad, Yoel Judah. His family moved to Trenton, NJ, when he was 13, and he found a gym outlet in Jersey, and got back to grind. Props to him, Trenton features plenty of lures to help take you off a righteous path.

Get this–he had 406 amateur fights. And did he ever just get bored of that, I wondered? “Did I get sick of it? Plenty of times! But never as a pro. As an amateur I’d be fighting every week, sometimes two times a day! But then I’d come back to it…it’s something I really wanted to do, because I knew boxing would leave me far some day. Where? The promised land! The ultimate goal is a world championship, and the only thing also I’m looking forward to is making sure my family is alright.”

Bunch has three kids of his own, and a step-daughter he’s folded in, as well as five sisters and two brothers.

Fortunately, COVID hasn’t clamped down on Shinard Bunch, he shared. It didn’t take too long, 8 weeks or so, before he started seeing bad numbers in his region. “So I’ve been staying away from people, taking a lot of precautions, in the gym, wiping everything down,” he said, talking about that Lysol life. “At first I didn’t take it very seriously, but then I started seeing the numbers of dead. I knew it was not something to be playing with.” Pretty impressive, this guy hasn’t been afraid to keep grinding, working and traveling some to get fights, but he’s been on message with his hygiene and distancing, and stayed virus free.

“It’s still early in the year, I’d probably like to fight 7-8 more times this year,” Bunch said. He does a fight, then studies what he did right, and wrong, and looks to improve with each outing.

The young man simply sounds like he has his head screwed on just-right-tight. I expect he continues the momo and elongates Krael’s bad run.

“In a year, we maybe get a title, USBA or something, get to No. 15, and after that start raising the stakes, start looking at bigger fights,” Shinard Bunch said, in closing. “We’ll move slow…well, some might not call it slow, but for me, it’s a good pace, it’s something I love to do. Down the line, anybody in my class or level, Terence Crawford, Gervonta Davis, Teofimo, Devin Haney…I keep working, stay focused, the sky’s the limit.”","The last two victims got stopped out in round one, but Shinard Bunch doesn’t sound like he’s gotten enamored with the quick dopamine hit that comes from the KO1 win.

Holton boys win thriller, move closer to CSAA Silver title

Aidan Poling of Holton and Kyler Larson of Kent City made multiple huge shots down the stretch of this one,” Holton coach Keith Swanson said. “In the end, it came down to a couple clutch free throws by Holton’s Brodrick Fialek and a couple huge steals by Holton’s Carter Brant, which helped create the final margin.”

Poling scored a game-high 23 points for Holton, plus he had four steals. Fialek had eight points, while Wyatt Monette added six points and 10 rebounds.

Larson led Kent City with 17 points.

“I’m so proud of our players. Those guys have so much fight in them, it’s incredible to watch time after time,” Swanson said. “I’m just lucky to have them. An amazing group.”

EUR 679.7 million was collected in gross insurance premiums, an increase of 13.6% over the year before. The group's return on equity was 13.3%, which is 1.3 percentage points above the target return set in the strategy for 2020-2022.

Mercator expected to become part of Fortenova by month's end

BELGRADE, Serbia - Serbia's competition protection authority cleared the transfer of Slovenian retailer Mercator to Croatian group Fortenova, thus clearing yet another hurdle for the step that follows the bankruptcy of Fortenova's predecessor Agrokor. Fortenova expects the transfer to be completed at the end of the month. Fortenova said in a press release that the approval by the Serbian regulator means the group has met all regulatory preconditions for concentration approval in the countries where this was required: Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro and North Macedonia. In September, the European Commission also issued a concentration approval for the EU.

Some insurers allowed to pay out dividends

LJUBLJANA - The Insurance Supervision Agency sent a letter to insurers, reinsurers and pension funds, urging them not to pay out dividends until the end of September due to coronavirus-related uncertainties, insurer Zavarovalnica Triglav said. However, the paying out of dividend is allowed in some cases, as the financial stability of the companies overseen by the agency varies and not all of them were affected by the epidemic to the same extent. The companies which will act contrary to the recommendations will have to prove to the agency that they acted prudently. Their solvency coefficient must be kept above 150% and the paying out of dividends must not reduce the sources of own funds by more than 10% or hurt the company's liquidity.

Monitoring group MEPs voice concerns in debate on media freedom in Slovenia

Diverging views as Slovenian MEPs debate state of the media

LJUBLJANA - The situation in the media topped the agenda as Slovenian MEPs talked to reporters ahead of next week's European Parliament plenary, which will debate attempts to silence free media in Poland, Hungary and Slovenia. They provided diverging views on the situation and on whether this is indeed an issue that the EU should deal with. Milan Zver (EPP/SDS) said freedom of the media was not questionable in Slovenia and he sees no reason why Slovenia should be ""in the dock"". For him, the main problem is the ""explicit asymmetry in the media space"", as a result of which the right to receive objective information is not secured. Irena Joveva (Renew/LMŠ) said the competent authorities appear to have determined that the matter had gotten out of hand and that a debate on the European level was required, not least in light of Slovenia's upcoming presidency of the EU.

There are only an estimated 104,700 Bornean orangutans remaining, due to habitat loss, expansion of palm oil plantations, and poaching. (Photo: Bernard Dupont, Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre, Flickr, CC BY-SA 2.0)

In this week's Beyond the Headlines segment, Environmental Health News Editor Peter Dykstra and Host Steve Curwood learn about a group of rescued Bornean orangutans that were released back into the wild via helicopter to minimalize COVID risk. Next, they unravel an unexpected link between glyphosate use on banana plantations and the release of another pesticide stored in the soils. Finally, they travel back to the tragic 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, and the twenty-year legal battle that ensued between the State of Alaska and Exxon executives.

Transcript

CURWOOD: Well, let's see what's going on beyond the headlines now. And of course, to do that we turn to Peter Dykstra. Peter's an editor with Environmental Health News that's ehn.org and dailyclimate.org. On the line now from Atlanta, hey there, Peter, how are you doing and what have you got for us?

DYKSTRA: Well, hi, Steve. There's a story that is the nexus between the COVID pandemic and an environmental crisis in Indonesia, where rescued orangutans are being returned to the wild, despite of COVID risk because they're so similar in DNA to humans.

CURWOOD: Yeah that's right. I mean, a lot of zoonotic diseases, I'm thinking of HIV, for example, are found in the primates. But wait, these are rescued orangutans, so what's the problem?

DYKSTRA: Groups like the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation are looking to repopulate the wild. Bornean orangutans are down to about 100,000, that's a fraction of their original population. Palm oil plantations, other farms, wildfires, poaching are all claiming orangutan populations. COVID is a new threat, and in order to guard orangutans from too much human contact, instead of driving the orangutans about three days into the jungle, they're bringing them in by helicopter.

CURWOOD: Well, this is good news. I'm glad to see orangutans getting a chopper ride to avoid getting COVID and actually probably then spreading it among other orangutans once they got back into the wild. Hey, what else do you have for us today, Peter?





DYKSTRA: Well, glyphosate has been much in the news, a lot of lawsuits, judgments for millions, if not billions of dollars from people who say they've been made sick from glyphosate, now the most common weed killer anywhere in the world. There's a study coming out of the West Indies, that suggests a problem we weren't aware of. That glyphosate use on banana plantations could be releasing an old banned pesticide into the environment.

CURWOOD: Well wait, how's that supposed to happen? I mean, a new chemical releases an old one? How do you do that?

DYKSTRA: Well, glyphosate is essentially a defoliant, it takes down all sorts of vegetation. When that vegetation leaves and the soil is exposed, the erosion takes place. And in that erosion, old residues of a chemical called chlordecone, a probable carcinogen, is released into the waters and the land in places like Guadeloupe and Martinique in the West Indies.

CURWOOD: Okay, so they call things like chlordecone a persistent organic pollutant and I guess it was locked up in the soil there until the use of glyphosate started the erosion. How big a deal is this, Peter?

DYKSTRA: It stays dangerous for a long time, and we don't know exactly how big a deal is it. There are suggestions that it's found in other crops in Europe. They're just beginning to look for it. Although the chemical chlordecone is also known by another name, kepone. It's a likely carcinogen, it was outlawed in the US in the 1970s. Some folks may remember a major kepone spill in the James River, were not only a stretch of miles and miles of that historic river were polluted, but about a hundred factory workers were made sick by kepone pollution.

CURWOOD: Hey, what do you have from the history books for us this week?





DYKSTRA: Well, thirty years ago next week, a federal court rewarded a huge payout for Alaska fishermen, and others whose livelihoods were damaged by the Exxon Valdez oil spill. That was two years after the 1989 spill. The initial judgment was for about 5 billion. Exxon spent two decades and a lot of lawyers' money, appealing it down. The punitive damages were eventually knocked down to just over half a billion that was split between 32,000 plaintiffs: individuals, companies, governments, and of course their lawyers. But the payouts didn't happen until 2008, nineteen years after the spill, by which time 20% of the original plaintiffs had died.

CURWOOD: Boy, what a case study of that old aphorism ""justice delayed is justice denied."" Thanks, Peter. Peter Dykstra is an editor with Environmental Health News, that's ehn.org and dailyclimate.org. We'll talk again next week.





DYKSTRA: All right, Steve, thanks a lot. Talk to you soon.

Ever walk into a room and forget why you went in there? Or stare at a colleague's face for 20 seconds before you remember his name? Or try to remember the name of that movie, the one you loved, starring that guy—it's on the tip of your tongue! (It's Jeff Goldblum. The Grand Budapest Hotel.)Forgetfulness is normal and if you feel like you've noticed it more recently, you're not losing your marbles. You're just getting older. According to Harvard Health, there are seven types of normal forgetfulness. These include:Transience. Forgetting facts over time.Absentmindedness. Forgetting because you're not paying attention.Blocking. The inability to retrieve a memory.Misattribution. Only remembering part of something.Suggestibility. Misconstruing facts about an incident.Bias. Adding your personal bias to facts about a memory.Persistence. Memories that won't go away.Unless your memory loss is extreme or persistent, there's no need to worry about Alzheimer's or other serious memory diseases. (Dr. Gary Small, MD, a professor on aging at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, says ""About 40% of people aged 65 or older have age associated memory impairment—in the United States, about 16 million people."") But if your forgetfulness is simply driving you crazy, check out these simple strategies, techniques, and lifestyle changes you can make to improve your memory. Read on, and to ensure your health and the health of others, don't miss these Sure Signs You've Already Had Coronavirus. 1 Keep Repeating It Repetition is one of the easiest and most effective methods for remembering things. According to the University of Illinois, the Spaced Interval Repetition (SIR) technique was developed in the 1960's by famous psychologist, Hermann Ebbinghaus. It uses repetition at specific intervals to ensure you remember a fact or name. After you learn something and you want to continue remembering it in the short-term, repeat the fact to yourself:Right after you learn it.15 to 20 minutes after you initially learned it.After six to eight hours.24 hours later.If you want to memorize something in the long-term, you'll need to repeat it to yourself after one day, after two to three weeks, and then again after two to three months. 2 Try Learning in the Afternoon Even if you think you function better in the morning or late at night, studies show that it's easier to retain information if you learn it and review it in the afternoon. A study published in the Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research proved this theory. 68 undergraduate participants were provided with words to remember. One group was asked to only study in the morning while the other group only studied in the afternoon. The results concluded that, ""The subjects who acquired information in the afternoon had better performance than those who acquired it in the morning."" 3 Write it Down We don't mean a note in your smartphone or a doc on your computer. Put an actual pen or pencil to paper. Researchers at the University of Oregon conducted a study to see if physical newspaper readers comprehend better than those who read their daily news stories online. The study concluded that ""Print news readers remember significantly more news stories than online readers.""Reading online and from a computer screen is harder to recall than when it's written on physical paper. If you truly want to remember a fact or name, write it down on a piece of paper and review it by physically picking it up and reading it. 4 Use the ""Chunking"" Method The ""chunking"" method of memory is just as it sounds. You can chunk together tidbits of information to make it easier to remember, relating the info on some common ground. For example, if you're trying to memorize the items you need on a trip to the grocery store, you could chunk together items by where you'll find them in the store. So, apples, potatoes, and lettuce would all be chunked together as ""produce"" while soups and tomato sauce would be chunked together as ""canned goods."" Categorizing these items together makes them easier to recall than looking at a long list of unrelated items.""The benefit of a chunking mechanism is that it mediates the amount of knowledge that one can process at any one time,"" claims an article published in Frontiers in Psychology. By using the chunking method on a large amount of data or a long list of items, you may be able to more easily commit this information to your short-term memory. 5 Make Up a Story or Scene In order to remember something, you have to be interested in it. If your brain is bored, it can be hard to make it engage and truly learn new information. When you're stuck trying to learn boring material, you'll need to find a way to make it intriguing for your brain. Sometimes making a story or creating a scene that includes this information can be just what you need to engage your brain.A study published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) analyzed how people reacted to scenes that were created. The study concluded, ""The subjects were far more likely to remember high-value scenes than low-value scenes."" If you're going to use this visual strategy to remember information, it's important to create a scene or story in your head that's interesting to you or ridiculous enough to keep your brain involved. For example, ""One day, I went on vacation to Budapest and who did I see in the lobby, reading a newspaper? Jeff Goldblum! What a grand hotel!"" 6 Make it Rhyme ""In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue."" When you were a child learning the months of the year or the states, chances are your teacher sang you a little song to help you commit the complex concept to memory. You probably still remember these songs or rhymes and you might have even used them to help teach your kids the same concepts.You can still use rhymes or songs to remember information as an adult, as long you're ready to tap into your creative side. Take a recognizable melody, such as ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"" and set the information you need to remember to the beat. If this isn't working for you, create a rhyme that you can easily repeat using the information. According to The Memory Institute, ""Rhyme, rhythm, repetition and melody will help you remember by taking advantage of auditory encoding and your brain's impressive ability to store these audio triggers."" 7 Keep Things in Your ""Memory Palace."" You can create your own ""memory palace"" when you begin to associate memories and things you want to remember with physical items in your environment. This learning method is also referred to as the method of loci (MOL). It was developed in Ancient Greece and has been used ever since. You can tap into this learning method by associating a physical item in your current location with one concept you're trying to learn. When you attempt to recall this piece of information, you'll need to visualize the room you were in when you were learning it. By envisioning the item, your memory should recall the fact you want to remember.A study published in Advances in Physiology Education observed 78 second-year medical students as they learned about endocrinology while using the ""memory palace"" method. The students found the method helpful in retaining information. The study concluded, ""When asked to report whether they found the MOL helpful, all participants agreed. About 85.7% of the participants agreed that it helped them understand the topic better."" 8 Test Yourself When your grade school teachers used to spring pop quizzes on the class sporadically, they were really on to something. Quizzing yourself periodically can be one of the most helpful techniques for remembering information. According to Rosalind Potts, Ph.D., from University College London, ""People often think testing is useful because it tells you what you know and what you don't. But the more important power of testing is giving you practice retrieving information you've learned and establishing that connection in the brain.""You don't have to create a formal test just to remember your grocery list. Simply take the time to periodically quiz yourself on the relevant information you want to retain. 9 Focus on One Thing at a Time As humans, especially adult humans, our brains are going a mile a minute. In an instant, your brain may simultaneously be thinking about whether you turned off the stove, what time your meeting is scheduled for tomorrow, and if there are any good movies out. According to Psychology Today, you have about 70,000 thoughts per day. With all this happening in your head at one time, no wonder it's hard to remember things.If you're learning something that you know you want to remember, you'll have to block these thousands of thoughts out. To focus and remember, the Mayo Clinic suggests quitting the multitasking while you're trying to learn something new. You should also:Stop thinking about what you need to do after you focus.Take moments to practice focusing on specific subjects.Learn the time of day when you're the best focused and cut yourself slack in the moments you know you aren't.Stay away from distractions when you're focusing, including co-worker chit-chat, the TV, radio, or your smartphone.When you've mastered the ability to focus on one thing at a time, you may find improvements in both your memory and your productivity. 10 Use Acrostics or Acronyms Acrostics and acronyms are mnemonic devices that you can use to remember streams of words or phrases. One of the most popular acrostics you may remember if you ever learned how to play a musical instrument is ""Every Good Boy Does Fine."" This acronym helps you to remember the order of the treble clef, which is EGBDF. If you were ever tasked with learning the names of the Great Lakes, your teacher may have used the acronym ""HOMES,"" which stands for Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Eerie, and Superior.According to the University of Denver, both acrostics and acronyms are helpful when you need quick memory aids. However, using these word associations may only be useful for memorization and usually can't help you to remember in-depth concepts or context and meaning behind phrases. 11 Relate New Concepts to What You Already Know Since we already know that re-learning is much easier than learning from scratch, it can also help to relate new concepts you want to remember to those you already know. This learning concept is formally referred to as ""relational learning.""For example, if you're trying to remember that an acquaintance works as a teacher, you could try to associate a characteristic of this person with one of your previous teachers. By relating a new concept to something you already know, it can be easier to remember. 12 Try New Hobbies Your brain function deteriorates if you don't use it. Learning new things is important for brain health, but you don't have to read a math textbook to keep your brain sharp. When you take on a brand-new hobby you've never tried before, there will be a learning curve. You'll have to learn new terminology and movements that you'll need to memorize and practice.A study published in Psychology Science Journal had some of its 200 elderly participants learn new skills, including digital photography and quilting, while others performed familiar hobbies, such as putting together puzzles or listening to music. Cognitive skills were tested both before and after engaging in activities. ""Overall, the results suggest that learning digital photography, either alone or in combination with learning to quilt, had the most beneficial effect on cognition, and that the positive impact was primarily on memory function."" 13 Say it Out Loud One of the best ways to commit something to memory is to get physically involved in the learning process. By reading out loud or repeating a fact verbally, it's more likely the memory, name, face, or tidbit will stick.Colin M. MacLeod from the Department of Psychology at Waterloo, says, ""When we add an active measure or a production element to a word, that word becomes more distinct in long-term memory, and hence more memorable."" Repeating phrases out loud is a different way to present the information to yourself and commit it to your long-term memory. 14 Get a Good Night's Sleep The National Sleep Foundation recommends that adults get seven to nine hours of sleep each night. Not only does an uninterrupted, solid night of sleep help your body to recharge, it can also help with your brain's memory and cognition. A study published in Physiological Reviews concluded that, ""Ensuing REM sleep may stabilize transformed memories.""Sleep was also found to help your brain process memories, which may allow you to keep them for longer. The study found that ""Sleep benefits memory not only in the neurobehavioral domain, but also in the formation of immunological long-term memories, stimulating the idea that forming long-term memories represents a general function of sleep."" 15 Do Yoga Yoga is a great way to get your daily exercise and calm your mind. But downward dog can also improve your brain function. Yoga is proven to improve your brain's gray matter, which helps with:Muscle control.Sensory perceptions, including speech.Decision making.Memory.Sight.A study published in the Journal of Physical Activity and Health found that participants who practiced yoga for just 20 minutes a day had increased brain function. This resulted in these participants scoring better on brain functioning tests that measured how quickly they could relay information about their memories and how accurate the information was. Adding yoga to your exercise routine may help your memory to stay sharp and your brain functioning clearly. 16 Meditate Meditation can help you get in touch with your inner thoughts, and sometimes that's all you need to feel more confident in your brain power and memory. A study published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease observed participants who attended an 8-week meditation program. ""Most subjects reported that they subjectively perceived that their cognitive function was improved after the 8-week program.""Meditation can help to strengthen and exercise the components in your brain that are responsible for memory. By meditating for just 10 minutes per day, you're forcing yourself to practice laser focus and control of your thoughts. This works your mental muscle, keeps your brain young, and may prevent you from dealing with memory loss. 17 Re-learn Things We already know that repeating information we want to remember can help us in the memorization process. Spacing this repetition out in different increments can cater to either your short-term or long-term memory. But if you haven't kept up with your repetition game to put something in your long-term memory bank, you may need to re-learn it.Re-learning is different than the first time you learn something because your memory may be jogged at any point while you're completing the task. You're not really starting from scratch and you may still have faint memories or information relating to the subject you're trying to re-learn. Therefore, it's easier for this information to ""stick.""As Mark Hübener from the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology explains, ""Since an experience that has been made may occur again at a later point in time, the brain apparently opts to save a few appendages for a rainy day."" So, while re-learning may seem like a hassle, you should find it easier than when you reviewed information about a subject for the first time. 18 Read Every Day Whether you're into sci-fi, romance novels, or self-help books, the act of reading can keep your brain sharp and memory loss at bay. Since reading engages your brain, keeps it active, and strengthens your cognitive function, just a few minutes every day can help improve your ability to remember things.A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the U.S. concluded that participants who engaged their brains through puzzles, reading, or chess were 2.5 times less likely to develop Alzheimer's disease than those who participated in less stimulating activities, such as watching TV. When you practice focusing on one activity, such as reading, your brain may also get the same positive effects as if you were meditating, which is proven to help strengthen your memory.RELATED: The Unhealthiest Supplements You Shouldn't Take 19 Meet New People An article published in Psychology Today blames our inability to remember people's names after just meeting them on stress and cortisol. You may be psyching yourself up so much to remember names that you blank out under pressure. Try to combat this stress by focusing on the people you meet instead of your body's reaction to the situation. To remember a new person's name or details, Susan Krauss Whitbourne Ph.D., recommends that you:Process the name as soon as it's said.Repeat the name back to the person.Listen to his or her name correction, if there is one.The more people you meet, the more you can practice committing these personal details to memory. You can strengthen this part of your brain and eventually, you'll feel more confident about your memory in social situations. 20 Pay Attention It may seem simple, but a reminder to pay attention can sometimes be all you need to improve your memory. We already know that multitasking makes memorizing and learning less efficient, which is why it's also important to quiet your brain as you attempt to remember or learn something new.According to the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development (ASCD), ""Attention generally begins as a passive process—the brief unfocused reception of the multitude of molecules and rays that continually bombard our body's specialized sensory receptors with information on the outside environment."" Since paying attention starts as a passive process, you'll have to make a conscious effort to forget everything else that's going on and solely focus on the concept you want to learn or remember. You'll know your attention has been captivated when unexpected distractions don't disrupt your focus. 21 Play Brain Games Crossword and sudoku puzzles aren't just fun activities to pass time. They may also be able to slow down a decline in memory and cognitive function as you age. Commercial brain game apps on your smartphone or computer have also taken off in popularity and for good reason. According to a study published in Neurology, ""More frequent cognitive activity across the lifespan has an association with slower late-life cognitive decline.""The more active you keep your brain, the slower your cognitive decline. But you don't have to study complex math concepts to engage your brain. Glenn Smith, Ph.D., a neuropsychologist at the Mayo Clinic, conducted a study on brain games and geriatric participants with no prior cognitive problems. He had some participants engage in brain games while others simply watched educational videos for an eight-week period.Mr. Smith found that ""Those who completed the computerized training showed significantly greater improvements in general tests of memory and attention, even though those abilities weren't explicitly trained for."" Those who participated in the computerized brain games also reported less daily problems with memory in the weeks that followed than study participants who only watched educational videos for the eight weeks. 22 Teach Other People You must have a clear understanding of a concept before you can teach it to someone else. So, if you task yourself with reiterating facts about a person you know or your daily schedule to another person, you'll need to first be sure you have a good grip on it.Teaching is a great way for you to review what you want to remember and can be useful if you're trying to get a memory or concept to stick with you. A study published in Contemporary Educational Psychology used two groups of students to put the concept of teaching as a learning method to the test. Some students were asked to simply study material for a test later while others were asked to study with the intention of teaching other students about the concepts they learned.While both groups of students learned the material, the students who were tasked with teaching others still remembered these concepts when tested weeks later. 23 Eat Healthy Foods A healthy diet not only nourishes your body, but also your mind. Have you ever overindulged on an unhealthy snack, like ice cream or potato chips, and instantly felt slow and groggy? If your body is full of bad food, it can be hard for your brain to focus and retain information. According to Harvard Health, ""Diets high in cholesterol and fat might speed up the formation of beta-amyloid plaques in the brain. These sticky protein clusters are blamed for much of the damage that occurs in the brains of people with Alzheimer's.""If you're eating foods high in saturated and trans fats, a gene called apolipoprotein E, or APOE, may be to blame for your increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. This gene is related to high cholesterol and is found in those diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. While these fats are bad, mono- and polyunsaturated fats may be helpful for preserving memory. To be sure you're getting enough of these memory-boosting fats in your diet, eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. 24 Stop Stressing Stress makes it easy to forget things, usually because you're focused on too many things at once. If you live a life full of stress, you can also be prematurely slowing down your memory performance and brain function. According to a study published in Experimental Gerontology, animals that had prolonged exposure to stress hormones experienced adverse effects on their brain's hippocampus. This is the area of the brain that's associated with memory and learning.When it comes to humans, it was found that those exposed to several days of stress and increased cortisol experienced memory issues and impairment. Researchers also conclude that extreme stress can make sufferers more likely to develop anxiety or depression disorders. These types of disorders are directly related to a decline in memory loss. If you want to make sure your brain stays sharp, it's important to eliminate daily and chronic stress from your life. 25 Create Your Own Visuals Assigning a visual characteristic to something you want to remember can be a great way to keep it accessible. For example, say you're attending a video networking event. You're introduced to a group of people all at the same time. That's six names you've heard while saying ""hello""! How do you remember them all? Pick out one defining visual characteristic for each person and associate it with the name he or she told you. Then, when you need to recall the person's name, that characteristic should trigger your memory and the name should come flooding back to you.You can also create an imaginary visualization. For example, you put your car keys down on the coffee table and obviously need to remember where they are later. Create a visual of your keys dancing on the table and when you need to recall where they are hours later, this vision should come back to you. According to Psychology Today, ""It requires mental effort to do this, but if you practice you'll be surprised how quickly you can come up with creative ways to generate these images."" 26 Summarize Into in Your Own Words Memorizing something that someone else said or wrote can be difficult. In most cases, the way one person communicated information isn't necessarily the way you would have communicated the same information. Also, in most cases, the information given to you is in long-form and can be wordy. If you can summarize it in your own words into brief concepts you understand, it's more likely that you'll remember it longer.According to The Writing Center at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, summarization can make it easier to retain information and is an important skill to master. ""If you are unfamiliar with the material you're analyzing, you may need to summarize what you've read in order to understand your reading and get your thoughts in order."" Since summarization forces you to identify only the most important elements, it can be a helpful step in memorization of important facts. 27 Stick to a Healthy Weight Dr. Small warns, ""People with excess body fat have a greater risk for such illnesses as diabetes and hypertension. These obesity related conditions increase the risk for cerebrovascular disease, which often leads to memory decline and dementia."" Maintaining a healthy weight can not only keep your risks for developing certain diseases low, it can also preserve your memory and cognitive abilities.High-fat diets that include a lot of processed food are known to contribute to memory loss and other unhealthy side effects. However, a study published in Neurology found that diets high in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) could help protect against cognitive decline. The study stated, ""In an elderly population of Southern Italy with a typical Mediterranean diet, high MUFA intakes appeared to be protective against age-related cognitive decline.""If you want a diet that protects your memory and is also heart-healthy, consider following a Mediterranean diet. This diet emphasizes the consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats daily. Limited portions of red meat and dairy are usually eaten on the Mediterranean diet. 28 Let Go of the Stuff You Don't Need Your brain will never be so full that it can't take on new information. However, what's the point of filling your brain with stuff you don't need? While it's great to challenge your memory, if you don't necessarily need to memorize something, consider keeping certain information as a note in your smartphone or just letting it go completely.According to Scientific American, ""The human brain consists of about one billion neurons. Each neuron forms about 1,000 connections to other neurons, amounting to more than a trillion connections. Neurons combine so that each one helps with many memories at a time, exponentially increasing the brain's memory storage capacity to something closer to around 2.5 petabytes (or a million gigabytes)."" That's a ton of space! But as we age, information can get cluttered and crossed, making it hard to recall certain memories or tidbits when we need them. Consider ""offloading"" some of the information you have so you don't feel as much pressure to store it in your brain. 29 Don't Drink Too Much Alcohol can have a negative effect on your long-term memory and overindulging can make it nearly impossible to commit facts to memory. If you're heading for a night out but want to remember the new people you meet for a while, keep your drinking to a minimum. If you drink too much alcohol too soon, you may experience the dreaded ""blackout."" If you have a blackout, you won't remember conversations or actions you took part in the next day.According to a study published in the Journal of Addiction Medicine, ""Alcohol impairs different brain functions at different rates, and cognitive and memory performance are differentially impaired by ascending versus descending blood alcohol concentration."" So, if you drink in rapid succession, you're more likely to experience a blackout.And you and your friends may not even know you're blacked out at the time because there usually aren't any physical symptoms. ""Cognitive and memory impairment occurs before motor impairment, possibly explaining how a drinker appearing fully functional can have little subsequent memory."" If you want to remember your night out, take it easy on the booze. 30 But Maybe Drink a Little While getting black-out drunk is obviously bad for your memory, light to moderate alcohol consumption may be linked with a lower risk of developing memory loss. A study published in Lancet used 7,983 study participants who were 55 years of age or older and showed no signs of dementia or memory loss. Some of these participants didn't drink alcohol at all or drank heavily, while some lightly or moderately consumed alcohol. In a follow-up with these participants six years later, it was confirmed that, ""Light-to-moderate drinking (one to three drinks per day) was significantly associated with a lower risk of any dementia.""The reason alcohol protects the brain from the effects of dementia isn't fully understood. However, Dr. Small hypothesizes that ""it may involve an antiplatelet effect that lowers the blood's tendency to clot and cause tissue damage."" The study also showed that the type of alcoholic beverage consumed had no differential effects on the outcome. 31 Associate Facts with Movements If you want to memorize something, it can be tempting to sit down and think about it. After all, you want to eliminate as many distractions as possible so you can focus on committing something to your long-term memory. But many studies have shown that actually moving around is better for your memory than sitting in one spot.An article published in Frontiers in Psychology confirms the importance of getting your body involved with your mind. ""Embodied cognition approach suggests that motor output is integral to cognition, and the converging evidence of multiple avenues of research further indicate that the role of our body in memory processes may be much more prevalent than previously believed."" If you're trying to memorize facts or a long list of items, walking while studying may be more beneficial than sitting still. 32 Record Your Voice If you think you're an auditory learner, you learn best by hearing information. A study published in Current Health Sciences Journal claims that about 30% of the population learns best through listening. According to this study, auditory learners ""require verbal lectures and discussions, role-playing exercises, structured sessions and reading aloud. In other words, written information may have little meaning until it is heard.""So, if you're studying a written list of grocery items or a group of people's names, you may find it hard to memorize on paper. Instead, record yourself reading the information you want to remember. You can easily do this on your smartphone or computer. Play your audio back as frequently as possible and focus on what you're saying or repeat it back to yourself. With this technique, it can be easier to commit information to memory. 33 Exercise Physical activity is proven to keep your brain sharp, making it easier to remember things. Not only is daily exercise great for your body and can ward off chronic conditions and diseases, it may also help you remember to stop by the post office tomorrow or wish your cousin a happy birthday. According to Dr. Small, ""A recent study of healthy adults between ages 60 and 75 found that mental tasks involved in executive control—monitoring, scheduling, planning, inhibition, and memory—improved in a group taking aerobic exercise but not in a control group.""A study published in Psychology and Aging found that study participants showed an improvement in memory and cognitive processing after only a 15-minute exercise session. If you want to keep your memory on point, add exercise to your daily routine. 34 Go to School Education can help you to develop learning and memory strategies. With coursework, you're forced to quickly determine your favored learning method and work on focusing so you can succeed. If you had the ability to figure out how you learn best when you're younger, you may find it easier when you're older to memorize a phone number or the names of your colleagues at a new job.Skimping out on your education not only makes it harder to develop these learning skills, it can also increase your risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. A study published in the Journals of Gerontology found, ""Case-control analyses with prevalent cases showed low education to be a risk for Alzheimer's disease."" In this study, ""low education"" participants were those who had six years or less of schooling. Use your school experiences to tap into the learning methods that work for you so you can keep your memory sharp. 35 Make a List Have you noticed the increasing popularity of lists as a way to provide information? (You're reading one!)Your brain can more easily retain concepts when they're organized and a list can help your brain to feel it's looking at information that isn't overwhelming. An article published in Psychology and Information confirms that there is a ""Human tendency to locate information spatially."" The way information is organized and where it is on the page may be directly related to your ability to understand and remember it.If you're trying to memorize a chunk of information, your brain may not know where to go first. Consider re-organizing it into a list, maybe even a numbered list, so you can focus on one thing first, another thing second, and so on. 36 Understand the Context of What You're Memorizing If you just need to keep a few facts, names, or tidbits in your head for a bit, you should be able to get away with using memorization tactics. However, if you're looking for something to stick in your long-term memory, you'll have to delve deeper and try to understand the context of the information.An article published in Higher Education discusses the differences between learning information through memorization and learning through context. ""Using a deep approach a student has the intention to understand. Information may be remembered, but this is viewed as an almost unintentional by-product.""To understand the context of a fact, you'll need to read it and relate it to the world. Instead of simply trying to memorize names, dates, or numbers associated with the information, applying it to your life and knowledge of the world can better help you to achieve the context. 37 Make it a Priority If remembering something is important to you, make it a priority. Prepare yourself to focus on what you need to remember and don't let distractions get in your way.For example, if you're attending a social event and your priority is to make new friends, focus on getting attendees' names and personal tidbits and making them stick in your brain. Don't let the environment or your inner thoughts take you away from listening and remembering what you're learning about your new acquaintances. If you can identify the information as a priority that you want to remember and can keep other thoughts or distractions at bay, you're more likely to maintain focus and commit these tidbits to your long-term memory.RELATED: Dr. Fauci Says Most People Did This Before Catching COVID 38 Take Ibuprofen (Only if You Already Are) Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are found in ibuprofen and are what can help stop your aches, pains, or headaches. Some studies also show that a small daily dose of these NSAIDs can ward off the onset of Alzheimer's disease. A study published in Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience claims, ""Meta-analysis demonstrated that current or former NSAID use was significantly associated with reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease compared with those who did not use NSAIDs.""However, most doctors don't recommend starting an ibuprofen regimen just to reduce your risk of Alzheimer's disease since the results simply aren't significant enough to outweigh the risks. If you're already taking ibuprofen regularly for another ailment, such as arthritis, you may also be decreasing your chances of developing Alzheimer's disease. But there are other negative side effects associated with daily ibuprofen use, such as stomach bleeding. So don't start taking it every day unless you've been instructed to by your doctor. 39 Quit Smoking Smoking can increase your risk for developing serious chronic conditions and deadly diseases, including cancer and heart disease. But this bad habit can also negatively affect your memory. A study published in Neurology linked smoking directly to the onset of Alzheimer's disease.The study concluded that ""Smokers had double the risk of getting Alzheimer's disease than people who never smoked."" Smoking increases your risk for memory loss as your body ages. However, if you quit smoking, no matter what age you are, you can instantly reduce your risk. 40 Figure Out Your Learning Method Everyone has their own way of remembering details. You may be able to remember things better when you can visually see them while another person may find it easier to remember concepts after hearing about them orally. The only way to figure out which senses trigger your memory is to try out different learning methods.According to the Center for Learning and Development, you should try out several learning and memory methods, such as relational learning or acronyms. While you may be able to identify one learning method that seems to work best for you, certain concepts may be better memorized using a different learning method, so you'll need to be open. For example, you may respond best to relational learning. However, if you're attempting to remember all the U.S. state capitals, you may find it easier to use a rhyming method to jog your memory.

22 hours ago,Entertainment Tonight,Chrissy Teigen Shares Why Meghan Markle Headlines Hit 'Too Close to Home' for Her,"Chrissy Teigen is sympathetic to what Meghan Markle is going through. The 35-year-old model took to Twitter on Friday to come out against the recent negative headlines about Markle, who's currently expecting her second child with Prince Harry after a miscarriage last summer. The pair shares a son, 1-year-old Archie.

""this meghan markle s**t is hitting too close to home for me,"" Teigen tweeted. ""these people won’t stop until she miscarries. f**king stop it.""

The tweet comes after Teigen experienced a pregnancy loss last September with her and husband John Legend's third child, a son named Jack. The pair is parents to Luna, 4, and Miles, 2.

After the pregnancy loss, Teigen was criticized for sharing photos of herself with Jack, with some online writing that she should've kept them to herself. As for the critics, though, Teigen told Good Morning America, ""I don't care if you were offended or disgusted.""

Ahead of the royal couple's highly anticipated interview with Oprah Winfrey, The Times published an article that claimed that the Duchess of Sussex bullied her royal aides and made them cry.

A spokesperson for the pair said in a statement that the claims were a ""calculated smear campaign based on misleading and harmful misinformation,"" while Buckingham Palace announced that they're launching an investigation into the matter.

Teigen isn't the only celebrity to share their support for Markle. Her former Suits co-star, Patrick J. Adams, posted several tweets in Markle's defense, while others including Gabrielle Union, Chance the Rapper and Roxane Gay have also spoken out in support.

The couple will speak out themselves in the upcoming 90-minute special, Oprah With Meghan and Harry: A CBS Primetime Special, which airs March 7 at 8 p.m. ET on CBS.

Here are your Arsenal evening headlines for Friday 5th March 2021.

Grealish transfer boost?

Arsenal may have been given a boost in any future attempt to sign Aston Villa ace Jack Grealish.

The 25-year-old has been in superb form this season, scoring six goals and registering 12 assists as well so far and has been the subject of a great deal of transfer speculation, with multiple teams registering an interest in the midfielder.

He signed a new five-year deal last September worth £130,000-a-week but the prospect of European football could reportedly lure him away from Villa Park.

And this week, Grealish was asked on the UMM Youtube channel why he didn't sign for Manchester United.

He laughed and replied: ""You’ve got Bruno [Fernandes] anyway.""

And while Grealish's quip is not much of a giveaway on a potential exit from Aston Villa, it could indicate that he may look elsewhere as he may not be first-choice at Old Trafford.

Full story.

Striker decides next move

Odsonne Edouard has decided his next move amid links to Arsenal.

The Daily Mail have revealed that Leicester City believe they have won the race to sign the Celtic striker ahead of the Gunners as well as Serie A giants AC Milan and AS Roma.

In addition, the report states that Edouard has indicated that he wants a reunion with Brendan Rodgers - whom he played under at Celtic - and a £15m deal is close to being agreed.

The Foxes boss is said to view the Frenchman as a long-term replacement for Jamie Vardy at the King Power Stadium.

This potential blow means Arsenal and Edu may have to look elsewhere to find the perfect Alexandre Lacazette replacement.

As reported by football.london, the 29-year-old - who has scored 10 goals across all competitions for Mikel Arteta's side so far this season - looks set to depart this summer if the right offer comes in.

Guendouzi set for £25m transfer

Mikel Arteta has reportedly told Matteo Guendouzi that will be sold at the next opportunity.

The 21-year-old midfielder was swiftly frozen out of the first-team at Arsenal last season following events at the final whistle against Brighton and Hove Albion.

Guendouzi has been getting regular minutes on loan at Hertha Berlin this season in the hope of returning to the Emirates Stadium this summer and staking a claim for a place in the team.

However, according to Football Insider, Arteta has no interest in giving Guendouzi a second chance.

In addition, the report states that Gunners have even slashed their asking price by £5million to attract potential buyers.

Previously valued at £30m last summer, the north London outfit are said to be willing to accept any offers in the region of £25m for the Frenchman who will be in the final year of his contract come June.","Arsenal may have been given a boost in any future attempt to sign Aston Villa ace Jack Grealish.

The Thomas Tuchel effect

Carlo Ancelotti, who managed Chelsea between 2009 and 2011, has spoken about what is different between the Blues side under Thomas Tuchel compared to Frank Lampard.

The former Blues manager said ahead of the Chelsea vs Everton match on Monday: “It's really difficult to say.

""Offensively they play a little bit different, not too much because the players are still the same. They are really consistent because they haven't lost games under Tuchel.

""They are solid, but this doesn't mean Lampard didn't do a good job. In my opinion, Lampard did a fantastic job when he was there.

""He [Tuchel] has the quality. He's a young manager but he's already had experience in Germany, experience in Paris and so he's a manager with a lot of knowledge and of course a lot of ambition. Because he's young.

""He's not old, like me! I have strong ambition, even if I am a little bit old!""

Ben Chilwell keeps Mo Salah quiet

Ben Chilwell did a good job of marshalling the Premier League's top scorer Mohamed Salah in Chelsea's 1-0 win over Liverpool at Anfield last night.

The left-back was tasked with keeping the 17-goal forward quiet and he did just that as Thomas Tuchel's side inflicted a fifth consecutive defeat at home on the Reds for the first time in their history.

With Jurgen Klopp's side a goal down, thanks to Mason Mount's first-half strike, the Liverpool manager decided to withdraw the Egyptian in the 62nd minute and sent on midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain on in his place.

According to Sky Sports, this was the earliest the 28-year-old had been substituted in a Premier League game since September 2017 and he was not at all happy about it, shaking his head as he walked off the pitch.

Klopp said the change was because Salah ""looked like he felt the intensity and I didn’t want to risk him.""

However, journalist Matt Critchley said otherwise.

The key quality in Tottenham, Atletico Madrid and Liverpool wins

Thomas Tuchel isn't surprised to have defeated Jose Mourinho, Diego Simeone, and Jurgen Klopp since taking charge at Chelsea, because the club has “everything you need to be successful as a coach”.

Tuchel has overseen ten games in charge of Chelsea and has guided his side to eight wins and two draws in all competitions. They have also only conceded twice in those matches.

There have been high-profile victories along the way. Chelsea overcame Tottenham Hotspur, managed by former Blues boss Mourinho, at the start of February and have since defeated Simeone's Atletico Madrid in the Champions League and recorded a 1-0 win against Klopp's Liverpool last night to move back into the Premier League top four.

After the win at Anfield, the Blues' first at the stadium since 2014, Tuchel was asked if Chelsea's results under his stewardship were proof the club had made the right decision to bring him in to succeed club legend Lampard.

The 47-year-old replied: ""I am flattered but I will give the flowers to the players and to the club. It is proven that Chelsea is an organisation and a club that has everything that you need to be successful as a coach and as a football team.

""It's my job to bring out the very best of myself together with the team; there is no other way to express myself than with team performances.

Handball rule change after Fulham vs Tottenham controversy

The International Football Association Board (IFAB) - the authority in charge of determining the laws of the game - have voted to update the handball rule.

IFAB confirmed that the rule now dictates that an accidental handball that leads to a team-mate scoring a goal or having a goal-scoring opportunity will no longer be considered an offence after the annual general meeting on Friday afternoon.

The decision comes just one day after the controversial decision to rule out Josh Maja's strike for Fulham against Tottenham at Craven Cottage due to a perceived handball by Mario Lemina in the build-up.

In an official statement on their website, IFAB confirmed that handballs will now only be given under certain circumstances, with the rule change likely to be introduced in England from July 1.

This includes when a player ""deliberately touches the ball with their hand/arm, for example moving the hand/arm towards the ball"" or when a player ""touches the ball with their hand/arm when it has made their body unnaturally bigger.""

The statement went on to add: ""A player is considered to have made their body unnaturally bigger when the position of their hand/arm is not a consequence of, or justifiable by, the player’s body movement for that specific situation.""

The latest update will be of no use to Fulham though, who ended up losing the match 1-0 due to a first half own goal from Tosin Adarabioyo.

Dele Alli 'switched on' when January transfer window closed

Hugo Lloris has admitted that Dele Alli ""switched on"" when the January transfer window closed.

The 24-year-old Tottenham Hotspur midfielder has struggled for minutes under Jose Mourinho this season with Thursday night's win at Fulham only his second start in the Premier League in 2020/21.

He was linked with a move to PSG and a reunion with former Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino in the French capital, but this failed to materialise in the January transfer window.

Once the window closed, Mourinho and Alli held positive talks and the player has got minutes in every game since he returned from a tendon injury, culminating in the start at Craven Cottage.

""Well, I don't want to talk about January. It's his personal situation and I don't want to talk on behalf of the club, I'm not the right person to do it,"" said Lloris.

""As a teammate, he's always been professional, he put his disappointment on the side and from day one in the second part of the season, after the transfer market closed, he switched on and he started to step by step improve his fitness and get as much confidence as he can.

""Now he's coming back and that's good for the team and obviously the best for the season is ahead of us.""

Tottenham absentees nearing return

And Mourinho has been asked whether Serge Aurier would be fit to face Roy Hodgson's men in north London.

""Serge I believe yes. He had that injury then he played the last match until minute 70, 75 when he started feeling his calf again,"" he said.

Newcastle takeover appeal suffers blow

Mike Ashley's appeal against the Premier League for the failed Saudi-backed takeover of Newcastle from last year has got off to a bad start.

Ashley began arbitration proceedings in November. Michael Beloff QC was named as the chairman of the Arbitration Panel, a decision that Newcastle initially accepted.

However, Ashley then appealed for Beloff to be removed after it was understood that he had a prior relationship with the Premier League.

The High Court has since ruled against Ashley and Newcastle, stating that Beloff will remain as the Chairman of the Arbitration Panel.

Despite the blow to the appeal, Chronicle Live understands that Ashley still believes that he has a solid case against the Premier League. He also reiterated his eagerness to fight the decision from the Premier League.

Ashley, in a statement to Sky Sports, said on Friday: ""NUFC (is) fighting tooth and nail, the fans and the region are being denied what they deserve.""

Bruce responds to Ritchie row

Steve Bruce has made his first response to journalists since it was revealed that he and Matt Ritchie had a row in training following the confusion that led to Wolves' equaliser at the weekend.

As Ritchie was introduced as a substitute, Newcastle attempted to change formation. Poor communication led to confusion, through which Wolves scored, and Bruce publicly criticised Ritchie in his post-match interview.

Not happy with Bruce's comments, Ritchie is said to have confronted Bruce, which led to the Newcastle manager barging into the midfielder.

And on Friday, Bruce gave his first response to the media following the incident, claiming that it has been ""blown out of proportion"".

""There is no denying I had a row with Matt Ritchie,"" Bruce admitted. ""That happens at training grounds up and down every week.

""You are dealing with 25 men and emotions run high and it is fiercely competitive. Unfortunately with Newcastle, it gets blown out of proportion. Matt apologised, and for me personally, it's over.

""It happens, but ours leaks into the media and causes a frenzy and with a big game coming up we could do without it.

""As far as I'm concerned it's over and we get on with it. The very following day he trained well and apologised in front of the staff and the players.""

Bruce won't resign as Newcastle boss

Bruce also said that he is never going to walk away from the Newcastle job, despite growing pressure on his position at the club after a bust-up with Ritchie, as well as reported unrest in the dressing room after it was leaked that Karl Darlow would be dropped from the starting XI.

The Newcastle boss admitted that it is up to others to decide whether he will be at the club next season, but also insisted that he will not resign.

""I sincerely hope so. That's for others to decide,"" he told reporters on Zoom when asked if he thinks he will be at the club next season.

""Look, it's vitally important that we all understand it: a row, a bust-up, whatever you want to call it, unfortunately, makes huge headlines in Newcastle and the disappointment for me personally and the club is, unfortunately, the so-called journalist has got a source.

""Fair enough. But to try and derail us and cause all this noise if that's what you'd call it before a big game? We could do without it.

Here are your Liverpool evening headlines for Friday, March 5.

Ozan Kabak blow

Despite being ravaged at centre-back by injuries to all three senior options, Liverpool's misery at the position is set to continue.

New signing Ozan Kabak, who was signed to temporarily replace Virgil van Dijk, Joe Gomez and Joel Matip, all of whom are unlikely to play again this season, picked up a problem in Thursday's 1-0 defeat to Chelsea and is a major doubt for the weekend clash against Fulham.

""Ozan after the game had a little problem,"" said Reds boss Klopp on Friday. ""He has played now a lot of games and we will see whether he is ready for Fulham.

""It doesn't look like it at the moment. We will have to find solutions.""

Klopp sets Salah record straight

Klopp has set the record straight on Mohamed Salah's substitution and future, stating that he pulled the Egyptian international off because he looked sluggish and not for any other reason.

""I cannot not change a player just because it creates a story,"" said the Reds boss.

""Afterwards, I didn't even think about these kind of things in the moment. You do it because you think in the moment it's right.

""And you (the media) are allowed to judge afterwards if it was right but it does not change my decision any more.""

Speaking ahead of Sunday's visit of Fulham, Klopp added: ""In the situation when you make a decision like that he looked, for me, like he felt the intensity. He probably saw it completely differently and that is completely fine.

""It's not the most important thing in the world, maybe 30 minutes without Mo Salah is why he could play again on Sunday.

""We make these decisions in the moment and not with any thoughts in behind. The problem only is you only have to explain it after the game and the day after the game - these kind of stories so far didn't happen.

""I cannot guarantee for the future and for all times it will never happen but these kind of discussions we never had.

""I could have changed other players, that's true, it was more who we bring on in this moment.""

Owen's wild Mane-Salah theory

Michael Owen has a wild theory as to why Sadio Mane has not fallen under contact in the penalty box in Liverpool's last two matches.

On two separate occasions, Mane bravely tried to stay on his feet when contacted in the box. Liverpool fans were calling for him to go down to win a penalty, but Owen has a strange theory relating to Salah and the Golden Boot that could explain Mane's insistence to stay up.

""I couldn’t believe he didn’t go down there and look, I’m not advocating he does,"" Owen said on Optus Sport.

""It was a great touch and he possibly thought he might get a chance at the end of it ... but he did something similar a week ago [against Sheffield United].

""I just wonder, and it might be a little bit of devious thoughts creeping into my head, Mo Salah is the penalty taker in this team, and if he (Mane) thinks he’s getting a chance to score he thinks ‘well I’m going to score, if I don’t stay on my feet, Mo Salah’s going to get another penalty.

""These players have been going for the Golden Boot for the past couple of seasons. It might be a wild sort of theory, but the competitive nature of him and Mo Salah. We’ve seen them not passing to each other when one of them is in a much better position to the other.

""We’re seeing a little bit of selfishness, we’re seeing a little bit of disgruntled behaviour - Mo Salah shaking his head [when he was subbed off].

""I just think a couple of times there, I’ve seen Mane go down for those kind of opportunities, and [to not do it] two games on the spin? It just made me think a little bit.""","""Ozan after the game had a little problem,"" said Reds boss Klopp on Friday.

Never say that one person makes no difference. This past Thursday, stocks tumbled, bonds surged, and investors started taking inflationary risks seriously – all because one guy said what he thinks. Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, held a press conference at which he gave both the good and the bad. He stated, again, his belief that the COVID vaccination program will allow a full reopening of the economy, and that we’ll see a resurgence in the job market. That’s the good news. The bad news, we’ll also likely see consumer prices go up in the short term – inflation. And when inflation starts rising, so do interest rates – and that’s when stocks typically slide. We’re not there yet, but the specter of it was enough this past week to put serious pressure on the stock markets. However, as the market retreat has pushed many stocks to rock-bottom prices, several Wall Street analysts believe that now may be the time to buy in. These analysts have identified three tickers whose current share prices land close to their 52-week lows. Noting that each is set to take back off on an upward trajectory, the analysts see an attractive entry point. Not to mention each has earned a Moderate or Strong Buy consensus rating, according to TipRanks database. Alteryx (AYX) We’ll start with Alteryx, an analytic software company based in California that takes advantage of the great changes brought by the information age. Data has become a commodity and an asset, and more than ever, companies now need the ability to collect, collate, sort, and analyze reams of raw information. This is exactly what Alteryx’s products allow, and the company has built on that need. In Q4, the company reported net income of 32 cents per share on $160.5 million in total revenues, beating consensus estimates. The company reported good news on the liquidity front, too, with $1 billion in cash available as of Dec 31, up 2.5% the prior year. In Q4, operating cash flow reached $58.5 million, crushing the year-before figure of $20.7 million. However, investors were wary of the lower-than-expected guidance. The company forecasted a range of between $104 million to $107 million in revenue, compared to $119 million analysts had expected. The stock tumbled 16% after the report. That was magnified by the general market turndown at the same time. Overall, AYX is down ~46% over the past 52 months. Yet, the recent sell-off could be an opportunity as the business remains sound amid these challenging times, according to 5-star analyst Daniel Ives, of Wedbush. “We still believe the company is well positioned to capture market share in the nearly ~$50B analytics, business intelligence, and data preparation market with its code-friendly end-to-end data prep and analytics platform once pandemic pressures subside…. The revenue beat was due to a product mix that tilted towards upfront revenue recognition, an improvement in churn rates and an improvement in customer spending trends,"" Ives opined. Ives’ comments back his Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, and his $150 price target implies a one-year upside of 89% for the stock. (To watch Ives’ track record, click here) Overall, the 13 analyst recent reviews on Alteryx, breaking down to 10 Buys and 3 Holds, give the stock a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating. Shares are selling for $79.25 and have an average price target of $150.45. (See AYX stock analysis on TipRanks) Root, Inc. (ROOT) Switching over to the insurance sector, we’ll look at Root. This insurance company interacts with customers through its app, acting more like a tech company than a car insurance provider. But it works because the way customers interact with businesses is changing. Root also uses data analytics to set rates for customers, basing fees and premiums on measurable and measured metrics of how a customer actually drives. It’s a personalized version of car insurance, fit for the digital age. Root has also been expanding its model to the renters insurance market. Root has been trading publicly for just 4 months; the company IPO'd back in October, and it’s currently down 50% since it hit the markets. In its Q4 and Full-year 2020 results, Root showed solid gains in direct premiums, although the company still reports a net loss. For the quarter, the direct earnings premiums rose 30% year-over-year to $155 million. For all of 2020, that metric gained 71% to reach $605 million. The full-year net loss was $14.2 million. Truist's 5-star analyst Youssef Squali covers Root, and he sees the company maneuvering to preserve a favorable outlook this year and next. “ROOT's mgt continues to refine its growth strategy two quarters post IPO, and 4Q20 results/2021 outlook reflects such a process... They believe their stepped-up marketing investment should lead to accelerating policy count growth as the year progresses and provide a substantial tailwind heading into 2022. To us, this seems part of a deliberate strategy to marginally shift the balance between topline growth and profitability slightly more in favor of the latter,” Squali noted. Squali’s rating on the stock is a Buy, and his $24 price target suggests a 95% upside in the months ahead. (To watch Squali’s track record, click here) Shares in Root are selling for $12.30 each, and the average target of $22 indicates a possible upside of ~79% by year’s end. There are 5 reviews on record, including 3 to Buy and 2 to Hold, making the analyst consensus a Moderate Buy. (See ROOT stock analysis on TipRanks) Arco Platform, Ltd. (ARCE) The shift to online and remote work hasn’t just impacted the workplace. Around the world, schools and students have also had to adapt. Arco Platform is a Brazilian educational company offering content, technology, supplemental programs, and specialized services to school clients in Brazil. The company boasts over 5,400 schools on its client list, with programs and products in classrooms from kindergarten through high school – and over 405,000 students using Arco Platform learning tools. Arco will report 4Q20 and full year 2020 results later this month – but a look at the company’s November Q3 release is instructive. The company described 2020 as a “testament to the resilience of our business.” By the numbers, Arco reported strong revenue gains in 2020 – no surprise, considering the move to remote learning. Quarterly revenue of 208.7 million Brazilian reals (US$36.66 million) was up 196% year-over-year, while the top line for the first 9 months of the year, at 705.2 million reals (US$123.85 million) was up 117% yoy. Earnings for educational companies can vary through the school year, depending on the school vacation schedule. The third quarter is typically Arco’s worst of the year, with a net loss – and 2020 was no exception. But, the Q3 net loss was only 9 US cents per share – a huge improvement from the 53-cent loss reported in 3Q19. Mr. Market chopped off 38% of the company’s stock price over the past 12 months. One analyst, however, thinks this lower stock price could offer new investors an opportunity to get into ARCE on the cheap. Credit Suisse's Daniel Federle rates ARCE an Outperform (i.e. Buy) along with a $55 price target. This figure implies a 12-month upside potential of ~67%. (To watch Federle’s track record, click here) Federle is confident that the company is positioned for the next leg of growth, noting: ""[The] company is structurally solid and moving in the right direction and... any eventual weak operating data point is macro related rather than any issue related to the company. We continue with the view that growth will return to its regular trajectory once COVID effects dissipate.” Turning to expansionary plans, Federle noted, “Arco mentioned that it is within their plans to launch a product focused on the B2C market, likely already in 2021. The product will be focused on offering courses (e.g. test preps) directly to students. It is important to note that this product will not be a substitute for learning systems, rather a complement. Potential success obtained in the B2C market is an upside risk to our estimates.” There are only two reviews on record for Arco, although both of them are Buys, making the analyst consensus here a Moderate Buy. Shares are trading for $33.73 and have an average price target of $51, which suggests a 51% upside from that level.

1 day ago,The LumberJack,Four years of handling headlines,"Unless you spent the past five years in a coma, blissfully unaware of the world around you, you know the news has been deeply weird and distressing.

I genuinely believe that the past four years have left a profound impact on my mental health, and that of many people across the nation. I have friends who have stopped reading the news entirely so they can go about their day without feeling hopeless. I’ve read articles about the Biden administration by journalists that seem positively shocked at how boring the policy details are. These past four years have left this country traumatized, a trauma we only now can begin to reckon with.

I was still in high school when Trump was elected. I vividly recall my blind confidence the weeks before the 2016 election, when my young, dumb, optimistic self bet my best friend ten dollars Trump would never be president. Fast forward to that infamous night. I was crying as I stared at the television screen, watching the electoral votes tick upwards as I envisioned the worst. That night I contemplated walking into traffic to spare myself the agony that awaited a mixed-race queer in the new America.

Time passed. I handed over the money. I went to the Women’s March. I learned that democracy was a sham. For the next four years, I checked the news, I opened social media, I watched television and every single day it was something new.

The president said white supremacists were good people. The president threatened nuclear war with North Korea. The president suggested that people inject bleach. It was never enough to simply enforce policy banning transgender people from the military or pulling out of the Paris Agreement. He always had to say things, truly hateful and outrageous things, that became the news because of his position.

I genuinely feel that some level of emotional abuse occurred. Gaslighting, threats, and wild accusations were common enough, and the hypervigilance that victims of abuse develop was certainly there. I was constantly looking to see what new damage to democracy has happened now.

Even when it wasn’t exactly bad, it would be strange, and the absence of news and its terrifying unknown would leave me more worried than ever. Bad news was addictive. I had to know what horrible things were happening so I could stay informed, and once I was informed it was my responsibility to stress about them.

For four years we lived under the constant anxiety that maybe today we would glance at the news and hear martial law declared. Maybe today we’d see World War III. Maybe today we’d lose the Civil Rights Act. It’s only now, when I look up the name of the current president of the United States and don’t see tweets accusing political rivals of treason, I realize that the news cycle wasn’t normal. We aren’t supposed to have panic attacks whenever we glance at NBC. That’s what CNN is for.

I know bad things happened under the Obama administration. I know bad things continue to happen under the Biden administration. I know it’s an incredibly privileged take to say that if Hillary had been elected, we’d all be at a coronavirus-free brunch reading about how world peace was declared. We will still have climate change, inequality, poverty, unemployment, corruption, and, oh yeah, a GLOBAL PANDEMIC. But the truth is, it isn’t healthy to see a constant stream of bad news all day every day for four years. It’s even less healthy to read the rantings of a man who believes in his word over facts and his ego over human lives. While this section is probably near the back and it’s a bit late to hear it, please put down this paper. Remember that you don’t have to steel yourself like a lab rat for the next shock. What happened here wasn’t okay, and we need to heal.","For four years we lived under the constant anxiety that maybe today we would glance at the news and hear martial law declared.

But the truth is, it isn’t healthy to see a constant stream of bad news all day every day for four years."
1 day ago,,Today's Headlines and Commentary,"The Biden administration has imposed temporary limits on drone strikes targeting suspected terrorists outside of war zones in Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq, according to the Washington Post. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan quietly imposed the new restriction on Jan. 20, the first day of Biden’s presidency. The new temporary guidelines require the military and CIA to seek direct approval from the White House before attempting to kill or capture suspects in places where the U.S. has a small military presence, such as Somalia, Yemen and Libya—a tightened standard compared to Trump administration years, where such authorization could be obtained from the U.S. ambassador to the country where the counterterrorism operation was to take place.

President Biden intends to work with Congress to repeal decades-old authorizations for military force and replace them with a new “narrow and specific framework” designed to protect Americans while reigning in the president’s broad authorizations to make decisions in the U.S.’s foreign military engagements, writes Politico. Two days ago, in the fallout over Biden’s decision to launch airstrikes against Iran-backed militia groups in Syria without congressional approval, a bipartisan group of senators introduced a bill to repeal the 1991 and 2002 Authorizations for the Use of Military Force.

Yesterday, Sen. Ron Johnson called for a full reading of the 628-page coronavirus relief bill in order to delay passage of Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus package, reports the New York Times. It took Senate clerks nearly 11 hours to read the plan aloud. Today, the Senate will debate the plan and vote on amendments—a process that, like yesterday, will likely be drawn out and could stretch long past midnight. Although Republicans are expected to continue their united opposition to the bill given its high price tag, GOP efforts to slow action in the chamber are not expected to ultimately change the final legislation.

The U.S. Capitol Police have requested a 60-day extension of National Guard protection activated in response to security threats in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 assault on Congress, writes the Washington Post. About 5,200 members of the National Guard are on duty in the Washington D.C. now, where they staff a perimeter around the Capitol building. If the extension request is not authorized, the troops’ mission will end on March 12.

The FBI has arrested a former Trump administration State Department aide on charges related to the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, according to Politico. The aide, Frederico Klein, was designated as a “Schedule C” political appointee at the State Department, where he had served as a special assistant in the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs. Klein is the first known Trump appointee to face criminal charges in connection with the insurrection at the Capitol, although further details on the charges remain unclear.

Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell has filed a civil lawsuit in federal court alleging that Donald Trump, his lawyer Rudy Giuliani and other allies of the former president are “responsible for the injury and destruction” of the deadly Capitol siege, writes Reuters. Swalwell served as one of the House managers during Trump’s second impeachment trial before the Senate last month. The lawsuit draws on evidence from the impeachment trial.

An independent market monitor has accused the Texas power grid-operator of overcharging residents $16 billion for electricity during the state’s cold weather crisis, reports the Wall Street Journal. The monitor found that Texas extended peak prices for more than a day longer than necessary and encouraged a retroactive reversal of the charges.

ByteDance—the Chinese company that owns TikTok—is working to develop a new Clubhouse-like audio social media app for China, according to Reuters. Beijing blocked Clubhouse in early February after a surge of users flocked to the app to discuss topics that are typically censored in China, such as the government’s treatment of Uighur Muslims and Hong Kong independence. Clubhouse-like apps in China are expected to accommodate censorship and government oversight.

Biden has named Tim Wu, a prominent critic of tech giants, to a position on the White House National Economic Council, writes the Journal. Wu will serve as special assistant to the president for technology and competition policy.

1 day ago,VICE,There's Nothing 'Ripped From the Headlines' In 'Coming 2 America',"In a country dealing with a long-overdue reckoning around race, celebrations of Black joy and abundance can be hard to find—not just in real life, but also on the screens that have offered an escape during an exceptionally hard year. It's a reality that Eddie Murphy has been thinking a lot about these days: ""[It's] rare when you have a movie that's all Black [cast and story] and it's not heavy,"" he told VICE. ""You're not just watching a movie; it's pressing all these other buttons. You're seeing a dark period in history, or civil unrest, or social injustice or something.""

Advertisement

But Murphy is no stranger to carving out enduring moments of respite: When Coming to America premiered in 1988, no one could have predicted that its story of a fish-out-of-water African prince searching for his queen in Queens, New York would have such a long-lasting cultural impact. The comedy, directed by John Landis and based on a story created by its star, Eddie Murphy, is more than just one of the greatest comedy films of all time; it's a timeless emblem of Black wealth, luxury, and life in two continents. With its glamorous set and costuming (think: rose petals dropped onto the ground by beautiful servants to protect royal shoes), Coming to America became an aspirational tale.

And now, 33 years later, Murphy and most of the film's original cast are returning to the world of Coming to America for a second go-round. In interviews with VICE, several of its stars—including Murphy, Arsenio Hall, and up-and-comers Jermaine Fowler and Nomzamo Mbatha—said they see Coming 2 America, as the sequel is called, as a much needed reprieve from the cruel realities facing Black people in America, and a chance for greater African representation.

This time, Prince Akeem (Murphy), happily married to Princess Lisa (an ageless Shari Headley, reprising her role from the original), inherits the throne of the fictional African country of Zamunda. But he needs a male heir, because without one, he risks being assassinated as part of a coup by rival leader General Izzi (Wesley Snipes). Because he and Princess Lisa only have daughters—with his eldest hoping to inherit the crown—Akeem is shocked to discover that he did, in fact, father a son some 30 years ago back in Queens, after a heavily intoxicated night out with his best friend and royal righthand Semmi (Arsenio Hall).

Semmi and King Akeem head back to Queens to find his son, Lavelle (Fowler). They bring him back to Zamunda to be groomed for the throne, with his mom (Leslie Jones) and uncle (Tracy Morgan) in tow. But then love, societal expectations, and other obstacles get in the way: Much like his father three decades prior, Lavelle finds love in a royally unideal place. In the end, King Akeem learns a valuable lesson on what traditions are worth upholding, and we blessedly see the reunion of Sexual Chocolate (as well as other familiar faces).

Murphy tells VICE that when Coming to America came out, he hadn't thought about doing a sequel, since the original story wrapped up so neatly, with Akeen and his bride Lisa living happily ever after. The idea of revisiting the story and its characters came to him ""organically,"" about five years ago. ""What we wanted to do was capture the spirit of the first movie,"" said Murphy. ""That was the most important thing, so if you watched them back-to-back, you have the same feeling."" That certainly comes through, with several throwbacks to the original and Murphy and Hall even re-shooting new sections to old scenes—passages which lend themselves to some excellent 80s looks.

Murphy said that seeing the movie's reach over the years has been a great source of pride: ""Coming to America is the very first movie in the history of the movie business that has an all-Black cast that was successful all around the world,"" he said. ""The movie kind of took on a life of its own."" However, he recently told Jimmy Kimmel during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live that the studio, Paramount, made them cast a white person in a role, which is how Louie Anderson snagged a part.

For the 32-year-old Fowler—a D.C. native who got his start in comedy and starred in the short-lived CBS sitcom Superior Donuts—being part of this story means ""everything."" ""This movie is one of the reasons I wanted to get into acting and make movies myself,"" he told VICE. ""So it's so full-circle to be part of the sequel. After 32 years, it's unheard of and such a beautiful moment. I'm super grateful and humbled by the experience.""

It's not hard to see why. I myself uttered the words ""I've come to Queens to find a queen"" the first time I set foot in the New York City borough. Black celebrities have recreated parts of the film for their own ostentatious celebrations, including Real Housewives of Atlanta star Kandi Buruss, who had a $400,000 Coming to America themed wedding, replete with lions and someone singing ""She's Your Queen to Be.""

Advertisement

Coming to America was a snapshot of Black life in the rough and tumble streets of Queens in the 80s. But it also provided viewers with a glimpse of a gilded, sumptuous Africa, ruled by elegant royals and resplendent with the trappings of royal life. For young people growing up in the 80s and 90s, the film offered a vision of the continent that stood in stark contrast to the images of famine and violence that dominated media and Hollywood representations.

""As a young man in Cleveland, I watched Tarzan movies, so that's what I thought Africa was,"" said Arsenio Hall. ""I loved being a part of what we created.""

""Before Coming to America, you gotta think about how Africa was presented in TV and film,"" said Fowler. ""It's just poor and impoverished; that was the American perception of it. And then you watch Coming to America, and you see the beauty of Africa; you see that it doesn't have to be perceived that way. I'm happy that in the sequel that the universe of Zamunda is expanded upon.""

That vision of an imagined Africa, rooted in reality but expanded in myth, set the blueprint for more recent films like Black is King and Black Panther. Some of them are set in a fictional country, and others in an unidentified amalgam of different real-life locales, but they all use fiction as a way of exploring alternative ways that we might envision the continent's present, past, and future—while continuing the work of debunking Western stereotypes and assumptions. (Although sometimes you have to wonder why Hollywood can't give this same grace to actual African countries.)

Advertisement

Like its predecessor, Coming 2 America plays on those perceptions—and turns them on their head. In one scene, Akeem and Semmi stop in at the barbershop they visited in Coming to America; it's filled with the same cast of elderly loudmouth characters—seemingly immortal—that Murphy and Hall brought to life in the original. The men clown on Akeem and Semmi incessantly, barraging them with names like ""Kunta Kinte,"" ""Ebola,"" ""Famine,"" ""Blood Diamond,"" ""Nelson Mandela,"" and ""Hotel Rwanda."" But when a random client in the chair tries to join in calling the duo ""those hungry babies with the flies on the face,"" he's quickly shut down.

""Whoa whoa whoa, that's too much. You stepped over the line now,"" says Clarence, Murphy's lead barbershop character. ""Politically incorrect,"" chimes in Morris, Hall's character. It's one of many examples in the film that show the evolution of Eddie Murphy's comedy; for fans familiar with his earlier work, it feels like a self-aware nod at the offensive and harmful stereotypes that once took center stage in his comedy, along with an acknowledgment that the rules are different now.

""Before your Black is King, before your Black Panther, there was Coming to America, which gave a glimpse or representation or idea of what African luxury would be,"" said Mbatha, who plays the Zamundan royal hairstylist Mirembe, Lavelle's love interest. Mbatha, who comes from South Africa and is making her major studio debut with Coming 2 America, said that seeing the ""cross-pollination of Black America, of Africans, of the greater diaspora"" coming together to make this film, and having most of the story based in Zamunda this time around, felt like a joyous salute to Black people everywhere.

""Every single day felt like a celebration on set,"" she said."" Nobody wanted to leave. ""It's beautiful that after the year of 2020 that brought so much sadness, we come together with this film. It's the perfect anecdote, honestly.""

Mbatha raises a good point: It's impossible not to watch Coming 2 America under the harsh lens of 2020 and 2021. For Murphy, it was important that nothing in the sequel mirror the experiences Black people are currently facing in America and beyond. His goal, he said, was to give viewers two hours of ""pure entertainment"" and ""escapism.""

""There's no moments stripped from the headlines in this movie,"" he said, ""You get two hours when you don't have to think about this stuff. You're in Zamunda, laughing. ""

Hall put it more bluntly. ""At no time does a policeman in Queens put his knee on Akeem's neck,"" he said.

In the end, Murphy, Hall, Mbatha, and Fowler are happy to be part of something Black people can be proud of, that celebrates their many cultures, and that gives them something to laugh with for a couple hours in this hellscape of a year. And seeing Randy Watson once again don that powder blue suit certainly delivers on that.

INDIANAPOLIS (WISH) — Jane King has a look at Friday’s business headlines.

Bed Bath & Beyond introduces new brands

Bed Bath & Beyond is introducing several new brands.

The chief executive officer says shoppers are increasingly skipping the national brand names and looking to try private labels.

It will launch six of its own brands in the next six months, aiming to get those items on shelves and on its website ahead of the busy back-to-school and back-to-college season.

It’s planning to launch at least 10 private labels in the next two years, while it simultaneously embarks on remodeling about 450 Bed Bath & Beyond stores.

Walgreens expands digital health platform

Walgreens is expanding digital health platform to add more providers.

The find care platform will have 11 new and four expanded collaborations with national and local providers.

Use of the digital health platform has rapidly increased to nearly 20 million visits, equal to a thirteenfold rise in web traffic versus last year.

Credit card with fingerprint scanner

Samsung and Mastercard are officially teaming up on a credit card with a built-in fingerprint scanner.

Per the announcement, all someone will need to do to authenticate a payment is pop their thumb onto one of the chips embedded into the card.

The plan is to allow for “safer interactions with reduced physical contact points” by foregoing the need to even bother touching a pin pad at all.

Netflix launching app similar to TikTok

Netflix is launching a short-form video feature similar to TikTok.

Fast Laughs is available only for the iPhone. Netflix said it would be testing on Android “soon.”

The feature will include a feed of funny clips from Netflix’s comedy catalog, including films, series, sitcoms and stand-ups.

The spring break season is traditionally the first major travel period of the year-but only about one in eight Americans plans a spring break trip this year.

Destination analysts says the data suggests that Americans remain wary about traveling amid the COVID-19 pandemic and that they may prefer to defer their travel plans until the process of vaccinating the populace is more complete.

For those who do plan to travel, the top reason is relax and escape stress.","Friday’s business headlinesINDIANAPOLIS (WISH) — Jane King has a look at Friday’s business headlines.

TOP STORIES

California’s New Vaccine Strategy

Months into a vaccine rollout that has been stymied by shortages and marred by persistent inequities, California is now going all in on a new strategy: flooding those communities hardest hit by COVID-19 with doses.

Officials say they hope the radical shift unveiled this week will not only slow the spread of the disease and tackle glaring inequities in who is receiving vaccines, but also speed up reopening of the economy by inoculating essential workers who are putting themselves at greater risk.

Under the new approach, the state will now provide 40% of its available supplies to underserved areas, such as in South L.A., the Eastside, Santa Ana and the mostly Latino communities along the Interstate 10 corridor between Pomona and San Bernardino — places that have experienced a disproportionate share of the pandemic’s pain, yet still lag behind more affluent neighborhoods when it comes to getting vaccines.

Deciding who should get access to the COVID-19 vaccine has long been an ethical minefield, as the demand and need for doses has continually outstripped supply. But some experts say giving priority to residents in higher-risk communities — many of whom live in crowded or communal settings and have jobs requiring them to be on-site — makes sense right now.

COVID-19 Relief and a Marathon Debate

The weekly $400 federal unemployment supplements included in the pending economic aid package being considered by Congress are set to stop in August rather than being stretched through September, as some Senate Democrats had requested.

The chamber began formal consideration of the $1.9-trillion COVID-19 relief measure after Democratic leaders agreed to reduce by several million people the pool of Americans eligible to receive $1,400 stimulus checks. The concession was intended to appease moderate Democrats worried that too many high-wage earners would receive the payments.

The Senate waited to release its version of the COVID relief package until it received assurance from the Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation that the legislation complies with budget reconciliation rules, the process that Democrats are using to pass the bill quickly without needing Republican votes.

Republicans largely oppose the measure as unneeded and wasteful. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) requested a full reading of the more than 600-page bill, a process that was expected to take more than 10 hours and substantially delay its passage. But Democrats remain confident they have enough votes to pass the package.

More Politics

— Democrats had hoped for a honeymoon spring. But bad behavior and grave unforced errors from Gov. Gavin Newsom and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo — two of the party’s biggest outside-the-Beltway stars — are distracting from the Democrats’ work in Washington.

— Can President Biden actually get an infrastructure initiative done? His two previous predecessors did not.

— Vice President Kamala Harris is emerging as a magnet for progressive pressure on the White House.

A Novel Approach

It sounds like a scene from the 1966 movie “Fantastic Voyage”: Doctors take a microscopic craft loaded with cancer-killing chemicals, inject it into the human body, and drive it to a malignant tumor to deliver its payload before making a quick exit.

Science fiction? Yes. Soon to be a clinical reality? Maybe.

Bionaut Labs, a remote-control medical microrobot start-up, is developing a device the size of a breadcrumb that doctors can insert into the spine or skull and magnetically steer to a target to deliver a precise dose of drugs. The plan is to move to clinical trials by 2023.

On this date in 1982, comedian John Belushi was found dead in Bungalow No. 3 of the Chateau Marmont on Sunset Boulevard.

“Police said they found ‘nothing out of the ordinary’ but they later led off in handcuffs a woman who drove up to the hotel in Belushi’s rented Mercedes,” The Times’ obituary the next day stated. “The woman was questioned for several hours at the Los Angeles Police Department’s Hollywood Division station. A police spokesman, Lt. Dan Cooke, said after her release that ‘detectives are now satisfied there was no criminal involvement on her part.’ ”

Later, it would emerge that Belushi, 33, had died of an overdose of cocaine and heroin. Catherine Evelyn Smith, who was accused of injecting drugs into Belushi, pleaded no contest to involuntary manslaughter and three counts of furnishing and administering controlled substances. She was sentenced to three years in state prison, despite the judge’s conclusion that the comedian’s “drug-infested life led to his own death.” Smith was paroled after serving roughly half that sentence; she died in 2020 at 73.

The state of California has been advocating for granny flats, a.k.a. additional dwelling units, to be built in backyards as a way to address the lack of affordable housing.

Here are your morning headlines for Friday 5 March.

Alun Wyn Jones to decide on his future after Six Nations

Wales captain Alun Wyn Jones will decide on his future after the Six Nations.

The second-row's current contract with the Welsh Rugby Union and Ospreys finishes at the end of the season.

Ospreys head coach Toby Booth said discussions about the next step would be held after Wales' final scheduled tournament match against France in Paris this month.

""It's something we're delighted to entertain with Al, he wants to get the Six Nations out of the way,"" said Booth.

""I'm sure those conversations are being had centrally with Wales, and we're inputting into that but we'll see where those conversations go after the Six Nations.

""Al's a quality player, there's very few players can come back off a medium-term injury ahead of time and do well at international level.

""He's a quality individual, we're very proud to see him perform well for Wales and he's desperate to play some more for the Ospreys as well so it's a win-win for everybody.""

Wales sweating on English-based players

Wales attack coach Stephen Jones says that having players return to their clubs during Six Nations break weekends isn't ideal as they go in search of a Grand Slam.

The English-based players will return to their clubs this weekend before returning to Wales camp ahead of their final two matches away to Italy and France.

""From a selfish perspective, you always want access to your players,"" said Jones.

""Especially in the fallow weeks, you want all your players here to sharpen their skills and out into place new patterns or new options, but it is just the nature of the beast that we lose guys to their clubs back across the border.""

Bristol boss expected Sheedy's Test rise

Bristol Bears coach Pat Lam says he isn't surprised at how Callum Sheedy has taken to Test rugby.

The fly-half has impressed since making his Wales debut in the autumn, being named the Six Nations Player of Round Three this week after an influential cameo against England.

“I wasn’t surprised at all,” Lam told RugbyPass. “Callum does the work, he is very composed, he understands the game really well and he is not afraid to call the right shots and he will back it. The best 10s for me, they make the guys around them look good.

“They have got to be game plan players in the sense what is the team looking to do and they drive that, that is one of the key components at 10. What Callum does is what he can do for the team. The show and go (against England), I see it all the time with us.

“His goal kicking has been excellent for us. There was an outlier that happened against Scotland but I wasn’t worried about it at all. I said he’ll come back and sure enough, he was back doing the work and hit six from six against London Irish.

“After the Scotland game, he had the game against London Irish to tidy up a few things. That was a bonus for him coming and getting some more rugby with us. He knocked six from six, took that confidence back into the Wales camp and was sensational with the goal kicks.

“Everything he has done on that stage, the intercept he has done that so many times for us. The biggest thing he does is the preparation. The key is preparation meets the opportunity. He is getting the opportunity, he has done the prep and that is what you are getting with Wales. It doesn’t surprise me.”

Wales prop signs new deal with Dragons

Wales international prop Leon Brown will remain a Dragon after agreeing a new contract.

The 24-year-old has put pen to paper on a new long-term deal and follows in the footsteps of Aaron Wainwright and Elliot Dee in committing his future to Dragons this week.

“It’s great to see our internationals all commit to their home region,” said Dean Ryan, Director of Dragons Rugby.

“Leon is a big talent who has a huge desire to push himself to get better and bring success to the Dragons.”





A product of the Dragons Academy, Brown has made 49 appearances for his home region since his debut in 2016, while he's currently won 15 caps for his country.

“I am pleased to be re-signing and staying at Dragons for another three years,"" said Brown.

“It’s a place where I enjoy playing, which is a big part in my decision, I am excited to see where we can now take the region.”

Scotland fly-half banned for Ireland clash

Scotland will be without fly-half Adam Hastings for their Six Nations clash with Ireland.

The Glasgow Warriors star was sent off in his side's defeat to Leinster last weekend after catching Cian Kelleher's face with his boot as he caught a high-ball and has been hit with a three-week ban.

Having missed the first two games of the Scots' campaign through injury, Hastings had been targeting a return for the final weeks of the tournament.

France boss faces crunch Covid-19 scrutiny

Bernard Laporte will appear before the French government today to explain the coronavirus outbreak that threatens France's involvement in the Six Nations.

The French Rugby Federation president must present the findings of the internal investigation into why 12 players and four backroom staff, including head coach Fabien Galthie, tested positive for Covid-19.

Laporte will face education minister Jean-Michel Blanquer and sports minister Roxana Maracineanu, who has threatened to withdraw Les Bleus from the Six Nations due to the outbreak.

France's round three fixture against Scotland had to be postponed because of the escalating number of cases and is set to be rearranged for March 26.

As the tournament favourites' next opponents at Twickenham on Saturday week, England will be monitoring closely the outcome of Laporte's meeting with the government.

France hope to provide the answers that ensure they can carry on playing in the tournament ahead of a likely title decider against Grand Slam chasing Wales.","Alun Wyn Jones to decide on his future after Six NationsWales captain Alun Wyn Jones will decide on his future after the Six Nations.

1 day ago,OperaWire,Criticism on Fridays: The Promising Little Headlines,"Every Friday, Polina Lyapustina delivers an essay on some of the most sensitive topics in the industry with the intent of establishing a dialogue about the opera world and its future.

Every year, Spring reminds us that it’s time to throw off all the heavy thoughts collected during the cold winter months. And now, we need it like never before, since this winter was made up of only bad news, broken negotiations, re-planning, and other uninspiring events.

I guess, I saw and dug into too many of them in the last months, but when I re-read the “The End of the Year” issue where I promised to report on how we survived the winter, I suddenly found that I had another viewpoint before. And reverting back to that, without being tied to showdowns in the upper echelons, brings significant relief.

If we observe the landscape of what was happening in the opera industry during the last three months, we will clearly notice two axes: X would be creative activity, while Y would represent power and money. And while the horizontal (flat) development of the industry went amazingly well and productive during the hard times, the vertical peaks only brought trouble.

All those bold headlines. Top management unilaterally decides on the activity or musicians’ rights. New laws and restrictions affect the work of the whole industry. All the money was spent on maintaining a heavyweight institution. You get the point.

But if we lower the level and look at the very heart of the activity, the picture differs markedly.

The opera world always had four important components: artists, institutions, spectators, and the artform itself. And while the fourth part always seemed somewhat weightless, it recently showed its independence and stability. We were all so scared to lose it due to the crisis.

“Opera won’t survive,” we said. Without open theatres, then without the audience, and definitely without musicians.

But I see the opposite — the institutions might be losing money, musicians might be losing jobs, and the audience misses the performances, but the art-form will remain, even if this crisis lasts.

Opera as an art-form requires nothing for its survival. Today, it is contained in scores, various recordings, and lessons opened for the masses. It also lives in the minds of the creators, even if we don’t see them. For years, this knowledge will be available for everyone to revive operatic activity. To restart it or even to start it from scratch. And this knowledge is (and should be) accessible for all.

This availability triggers the audience, who miss the live shows badly but never lose their connection with the art-form. Unsatisfied with the online performances at first, they adapted and learned to explore and enjoy the new experience. This winter broke the records in opera views online in Italy, on OperaVision, Arte, and even the compromised MET showed good results. And that’s without mentioning a wide range of unique independent experiences produced by artists on their own. And while these (mostly free) views don’t support the industry financially, they maintain the culture and push development further.

And here we see new approaches, so needed for the opera world (for decades), but never supported in the era of institutionalism. But in 2021, the premiere of the film version of “Soldier Songs” has replaced the major reiterations from big companies. And for the remainder of the year, opera as a cinematic vision will be led by several directors, most notably James Darrah who is set to spearhead a number of opera-related projects.

This marks the moment when opera becomes idea- and creativity-driven for the first time not in decades, but centuries.

While opera houses are not making many new major commissions, smaller competitions provide new opportunities for women and people of color. I hope opera won’t remain the same with these new authors. Without the support (and influence) of big money, the field of topics grows larger. More uncomfortable, maybe, but that is how the art becomes truly reflective.

Am I ready to sacrifice another masterpiece by Phillip Glass (whom I deeply respect) to that? I am. With no regrets.

New unexpected repertoire, approaches, and collaborations. People supporting artists, not institutions. Bottom-up decision-making in workers’ rights in Europe. And the total availability of high art. These tiny headlines inspire. Meanwhile, all these various small steps have the same value at their core — independence.

When we all became separated, there was no doubt that most people were left in horrid situations. Yet others also saw an opportunity for limitless possibility and found a way to empower themselves. It’s this example that is worth highlighting. It will protect us all from clinging to sinking boats.

You won’t stop being a musician without a theatre. Or an opera lover without weekly live performances. And opera will survive even if we won’t support it for decades. Yes, everything will be different, but we saw too many disasters of this pandemic to be afraid of changes.

When I see the stages in both Europe and States preparing to re-open, I notice that the more humanist they were in their approach, the less they raised along the vertical axis and the more independent they felt. And ultimately, this made it easier for them to revive. Technically, the process is identical for everyone, the only difference being whether the institution either respected or harmed its workers or the freelancers during the winter lockdown. #ArtIsPeople will turn into a very uncomfortable experience for those theaters that refused to listen to their people.

But then, it’s the workers’ turn again to play new rules. When we work, when we are back in the theatres, it’s us who decide to follow the rules, to fight them, or to create new ones. Inside or outside the walls, everyone decides for themselves. But it’s always on us.

In the end, I want to add another dimension, a third axis: time. Scared to lose our jobs, money, positions, we started with another shoutout last spring here in Europe. #ArtIsWork, we insisted. What a long way we have come to understand that following a simple math equation, being ourselves an art which is also a work, we can provide work to each other.

Art means so many things in the world, and being art opens millions of possibilities and empowers us to act, create, and decide on our own. Don’t allow the situations that have happened to the UK artists, Met musicians, Russian dissidents, German freelancers, SA singers to limit you — you’re capable of so much more than this. So…

Let’s make some real art?","Every Friday, Polina Lyapustina delivers an essay on some of the most sensitive topics in the industry with the intent of establishing a dialogue about the opera world and its future.

1 day ago,Paulick Report,Baffert-Trained Kalypso Headlines Sunday's Oaks Prep At Santa Anita Park - Horse Racing News,"Kalypso and Joel Rosario winning the Grade 2 Santa Ynez

Bob Baffert's well accomplished Kalypso heads a field of five sophomore fillies going a mile and one sixteenth in Sunday's Grade 3, $100,000 Santa Ysabel Stakes at Santa Anita. Baffert will also be represented by Baoma Corporation's Beautiful Gift as well as Pegram, Watson and Weitman's Heels Up in a race that Baffert has won a record five times.

With 50 Kentucky Oaks qualifying points to be awarded to the winner, the Santa Ynez takes on added significance as America's biggest race for 3-year-old fillies looms on April 30 at Churchill Downs. Saturday's second, third and fourth place finishers will receive 20, 15 and five points respectively.

Third, beaten 1 ¾ lengths by Kalypso in the Grade 3 Las Virgenes Stakes here on Feb. 6, trainer Michael McCarthy's Moraz will likely go as the second choice in the Santa Ysabel, which will be her fourth career start. A recent mile and one sixteenth maiden winner at Golden Gate Fields, McCarthy's A Real Hero will be a longshot with Flavien Prat aboard.

Owned by David Bernsen, LLC and Rockingham Ranch, Kalyspo, a Kentucky-bred daughter of Brody's Cause, out of the Malibu Moon mare Malibu Cove, broke her maiden going six furlongs four starts back in the ungraded Anoakia Stakes on Oct. 18 and then showed the way prior to running second, beaten 1 ½ lengths going 1 1/16 miles in the Grade 1 Starlet Stakes at Los Alamitos Dec. 5.

Off at 4-5 in the Grade 2 Santa Ynez Stakes going seven furlongs on Jan. 3, Kalypso pressed the pace and prevailed by 1 ¾ lengths. Subsequently second as the even money favorite going one mile in the Grade 3 Las Virgenes Stakes on Feb. 6, she was no match for Richard Mandella's Moonlight d'Oro, who rallied powerfully through the lane to prevail by 1 ½ lengths.

Although second twice at two turns, Kalypso, who will be making her seventh start, retains the services of Joel Rosario and is strictly the horse to beat on Sunday.

Owned by her breeder, Don Alberto Corporation, Moraz, who was a dazzling 11 length maiden winner going a flat mile two starts back on Jan. 8, kept to her task in the Las Virgenes when beaten 1 ¾ lengths by the top selection and her connections are hoping she has enough upside to turn the tables.

By Empire Maker out of the A.P. Indy mare Malvinia, Moraz will be making her fourth start and be handled by regular rider Umberto Rispoli.

Bet down to 3-5 as she stretched out to a flat mile in her second start on Oct. 23, Baoma Corporation's homebred Beautiful Gift stalked the early pace and rallied gamely for a half length win. By Medaglia d'Oro out of the A.P. Indy mare Sea Gift, Beautiful Gift also appears to have ample upside and will be ridden for the first time by John Velazquez.

Baffert's Heels Up, who has been idle since running third in the 6 ½ furlongs Dezi Arnaz Stakes Nov. 14 at Del Mar, will be stretching out for the first time in what will be her fourth start. Owned by Mike Pegram, Karl Watson and Paul Weitman, Heels Up, a daughter of Twirling Candy out of the Tale of the Cat mare Tale Untold, will likely be forwardly placed under Drayden Van Dyke, who will be aboard for the first time.

2 days ago,mlive.com,Plainwell’s title-clinching win headlines Wednesday’s Kalamazoo-area prep hoops action,"KALAMAZOO, MI - There’s a common progression among up-and-coming high school basketball teams in which they take their lumps with a young roster and grow into a battle-tested force after a year or two.

But don’t tell that to the Plainwell girls team, which wrapped up its first conference championship since 2015 with a roster featuring just two seniors and six sophomores.

The Trojans snapped a six-game losing streak to Edwardsburg with Wednesday’s 43-41 win over the Eddies to improve to 7-0 and claim their first outright Wolverine Conference title in six years.

“I thought we were going to be good, but it all depended on how our sophomores grew, and I thought we’d lose some early games and grow from there, but we’ve been fortunate to win these close ones, and the seniors have been able to step up when we’ve needed them,” Plainwell coach Tim Rieman said.

Edwardsburg took a one-point lead with two minutes left, but Plainwell sophomore Maya Johnson responded with a 3-pointer, and senior teammate Allie Hawkes sealed the game by making all four of her free throws in the fourth quarter and 9 of 10 at the stripe for the game.

Hawkes is the last of four sisters to play for Rieman, following in the footsteps of Shelby, Hannah and Hayley, and Plainwell’s longtime coach said he has seen Allie thrive this season after moving from point guard to small forward.

“I’ll take some of the blame for that because she’s not a natural point guard, and she struggled in that role a bit,” Rieman said. “We moved her to small forward, where she can attack more, and she has been super aggressive offensively and feels more at ease to react than having to make decisions with the ball, and she’s doing a fantastic job at both ends.”

Hawkes led the Trojans with 16 points, while junior Lauren Vanderstelt added 12 and Johnson six points.

Plainwell still has four games left against Wolverine Conference opponents, including Saturday’s matchup with Paw Paw, but since the league decided to award its championship once every conference team had played each other once, the Trojans can play with a little less pressure down the stretch.

That’s not to say Rieman expects his team to mail it in until the district tournament, and he noted his team still has plenty of things to improve for the playoffs.

“Even though we won last night, we had a lot of turnovers and missed some pups, but I think part of the reason they’re good in clutch situations is that they’re so young and don’t realized they’re supposed to be nervous,” he said.

Plainwell’s big win wasn’t the only notable result from Wednesday’s high school hoops action, so follow along for more scores, stats and highlights from around Kalamazoo.

Schoolcraft boys extend win streak to 30

In normal seasons, it’s only the state champions that can say they won their final game of the high school basketball season, but the coronavirus-shortened 2019-20 campaign ended abruptly for the Schoolcraft boys, who posted a 21-0 record heading into the district finals.

The Eagles graduated four seniors from that team, including starters Kobe Clark and Trevor DeGroote, but they haven’t missed a beat in 2021 and moved to 9-0 with Wednesday’s 61-27 win over Delton Kellogg.

Senior big man Bryce VanderWiere led the way with 22 points and 10 rebounds, while freshman point guard Shane Rykse and sophomore wing Eli DeVisser added nine points apiece.

Schoolcraft trailed 12-10 after the first quarter, but went on a 32-10 run spanning the second and third quarters to put the game out of reach.

Among Schoolcraft’s notable nonconference wins during the 30-game streak are this season’s victories over Grand Rapids Covenant Christian (60-55) and last year’s triumphs over Hopkins (58-56), Battle Creek Central (65-43), Edwardsburg (48-36), Richland Gull Lake (72-54) and Battle Creek Pennfield (58-31).

The Eagles are ranked fifth in the latest Associated Press Division 3 poll and have another tough non-league matchup on Saturday, when they play No. 6 Pewamo-Westphalia (7-0) at Cornerstone University in Grand Rapids.

2 days ago,Streetsblog New York,"Thursday’s Headlines: Andrew Cuomo, Dinosaur Edition","Thursday’s Headlines: Andrew Cuomo, Dinosaur Edition

Yesterday, the Andrew Cuomo Less-Than-Total-Contrition Tour did another round, in the form of an Albany presser in which the governor refused to resign in the face of calls that he do so because of the sexual-harassment scandal engulfing his administration.

Cuomo “apologized” to two female former government employees who said that he had pulled moves on them, hemming and hawing that he feels “terrible” and “embarrassed” that the young women perceived his remarks as predatory and insisting that he “never ever meant” anything inappropriate by them. As for a third woman who was aghast that he grabbed and kissed her face at a wedding, he said, “you can go find hundreds of pictures of me kissing people, men, women,” which, he explained, “was my father’s way of greeting people.”

We’ll see if it all flies.

Still, Cuomo acknowledged an uncomfortable truth for a guy his age (63): He may be the most powerful man in New York, but he’s behind the times.

“I understand that sensitivities have changed and behavior has changed and I get it. And I’m going to learn from it,” he told reporters.

Count us as skeptical. We may have a one-track mind, but we’ll believe that Big Dog Excelsior Car Guy really “gets” that it’s not Mario Cuomo’s New York when he … ditches the muscle cars. Because if there’s one area in which “sensitivities have changed and behavior has changed” and, not to forget, climate has changed, it is that this state needs to jettison the dominant car culture, stat. So you want to be a progressive, governor? Fess up to the harassment and bullying of women and subordinates more generally. And, for our part, we’d ask you to mothball the Trans Ams, which many New Yorkers of your generation (perhaps you, too?) remember as sex aids.

2 days ago,CBSSports.com,2021 NFL Draft: Trey Lance headlines five small-school prospects who could land in first three rounds,"The 2021 NFL Draft class has five small-school prospects with legitimate chances to be selected before the third day of the draft, and one is bound to be picked in Round 1, maybe inside the top 10. He's a quarterback. You know him.

Let's dive into those prospects from the FCS, Division II and even Division III level who'll be wearing NFL uniforms this fall and have the talent to make an impact early in their pro careers.

Trey Lance, QB, North Dakota State

Lance likely needs no introduction, and he's bound to be picked somewhere in the top 15. The one-year starter for the Bison has the natural talent of a No. 1 overall pick. His pocket presence, accuracy, and field reading need to improve. Then again, what we saw from Lance in 2019 that made him arrive as a serious draft prospect occurred when he was 19 years old.

Therefore, in a way, he's ahead of where most top quarterback prospects are at that age with that little experience. If the team that picks him is patient, and he's deployed in a play-action, roll-out based system and uses him in the designed run game, Lance will eventually be one of the best young quarterbacks in the league.

Dillon Radunz, OT, North Dakota State

Radunz is the closest thing to a finished product in the trenches among small-school prospects in this class. From smoothly exploding out of his stance to sliding inside against counters -- he has the athletic gifts to stay on the edge in the NFL. He has a ways to go in the power department but has the frame to add 10-15 pounds without sapping his athleticism.

The technique and athleticism are NFL-starter quality. While he'll likely take his lumps early on because of his strength deficiency, weight is the easiest thing for a blocker to add once he's in the league. Radunz should land somewhere in the second or early third round.

Quinn Meinerz, iOL, Wisconsin-Whitewater

Meinerz, the darling of the 2021 Senior Bowl, practiced his way into the second or third round in Mobile. Seriously. At 6-3 and 320 pounds with long 33-inch arms for the guard spot, Meinerz repeatedly moved Power 5 defensive linemen in the run game and stymied them as pass rushers on a routine basis during one-on-one drills.

Of course, on film at Wisconsin-Whitewater, Meinerz was a bull dozer with no off switch. There's good mobility to his game but in terms of explosiveness and lateral agility -- and we got a glimpse at the Senior Bowl -- he's at least powerful enough to deal with NFL-caliber rookies.

Robert Rochell, CB, Central Arkansas

Rochell has size teams want in their outside cornerbacks. He's just under 6-0 and 200 pounds and has long arms over 32 inches. Rare size profile. On film, his speed makes a first impression. He's aggressive at the line of scrimmage in press -- where he played often -- because he trusts his recovery speed if initially beaten.

Despite the outstanding explosion and overall athletic gifts, Rochell isn't overly effective disrupting routes at the line of scrimmage. He is more of a freaky athlete right now than a refined route-recognizing, ball-awareness cornerback. But his long arms and high-end athletic tools -- particularly his speed -- could get him drafted late on Day 2.

Spencer Brown, OT, Northern Iowa



At over 6-8 and 314 pounds with 34-inch arms, Brown is going to far exceed every team's length threshold for the offensive tackle position, and he's a twitchy athlete who explodes out of his stance. Importantly, too, Brown understands defensive ends are going to try to out leverage him, so he plays with really good knee bend.

For as springy as his kick slide is in pass protection, he tends to create a shallow arc with it, so defenders have an easy path to the quarterback, and pass-rushing moves tend to get the best of him. While he does demonstrate high-end strength on film, he's going to need to add weight -- and his frame has plenty of room for it -- and get stronger going from the FCS level to the NFL.

He'll rightfully get hit with the developmental tackle label during the pre-draft process, but at his size with his athletic gifts, Brown could sneak into the latter stages of Day 2.","The 2021 NFL Draft class has five small-school prospects with legitimate chances to be selected before the third day of the draft, and one is bound to be picked in Round 1, maybe inside the top 10.

Daniel Jones New York Giants · QB This is likely Jones’ last shot to prove he’s The Man in New York. If he stumbles through another mediocre season, both the 2019 first-rounder and GM Dave Gettleman will be out of the picture come 2022.

The NFL is called “Not For Long” by players for a reason. When you are in the business of playing to win, you have to prove your worth or you won’t be around long. Daniel Jones has shown flashes of brilliance while also making head-scratching mistakes. The Giants must improve around Jones for sure, but Jones must also be able to elevate his play to show he was worth the sixth overall pick.

Free agency matchmaking: 1 fit for each NFC team | NFL.com

New York Giants Takkarist McKinley DE | Age: 25 McKinley’s time in Atlanta ended in ugly fashion, with the defender making public pleas for his freedom and bashing the franchise in the process. There was something in the former first-round pick, though, and it only takes returning to his film from his first three seasons to see it. As my colleague Gregg Rosenthal wrote in his top 101 free agents, McKinley showed legitimate juice and might just need the right fit to turn things around. Joe Judge’s Giants feel like that organization, and after the way McKinley’s time with the Falcons ended, he could be had for cheap.

Takkarist McKinley is an interesting choice. While he has plenty of talent, the former 2017 first rounder has plenty of questions, too. He’s put up 17.5 sacks, 22 tackles for loss, 45 QB hits and two forced fumbles in four seasons and plays with an athletic edge. However, the fallout between him and the Falcons that led to his release (and the two failed physicals that ensued before landing with the Raiders) raise some red flags. What do you think Giants fans?

Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers may want to give Descenders a miss as it's included in the Game Pass library, but for all of those with Gold, the extreme downhill mountain biking game is definitely worth checking out if you're up for tackling procedurally generated worlds filled with jumps, slopes, and treacherous terrain. There isn't an easy completion here with Descenders — estimates suggest that unlocking all of its achievements will take well over 200 hours — but there's certainly a lot of fun to be had. Going Under is a dungeon crawler where you explore failed tech startups, and it might be your ticket to a free 1,000G. According to estimates, a completion will take between 12 and 15 hours, which is more than manageable over the free weekend.

Here are your rugby morning headlines for Thursday, March 4.

Dallaglio: I've completely changed my mind on Alun Wyn Jones

Lawrence Dallaglio says he has completely changed his mind over Wales skipper Alun Wyn Jones and has backed him to play a big role for the Lions this summer.

The former England captain has admitted he has been surprised by the Ospreys' man's return to form, stating that he had his doubts over Jones following the Autumn Nations series in which Wales collectively struggled.

But the Six Nations have been a different story all together, with Jones back to his swashbuckling best, and Dallagio says that despite his age, Jones remains one of his first picks for the tourists against South Africa.

“I was one of these people questioning how much longer can Alun Wyn Jones keep going,"" he said, speaking in a Q&A session with BFBS in partnership with military charity Tickets for Troops.

""He’s 35, he’s been an incredible player over 100 games for Wales, record Test player but, I just wondered maybe based on what I saw in the autumn whether he could keep going as long as the Lions tour.

""If you had asked me pre-Six Nations I would have said maybe (Maro) Itoje and James Ryan would have been my first and second choices for the second row.

""But based on his outstanding performances, I have completely changed my opinion and I have every right to do that based on what I have seen and I think Alun Wyn Jones has proved to me and everyone what a world-class player and a skipper he is even despite his age, so he would be one of my first picks straightaway.

""Itoje definitely would be there, he’s a glorious, wonderful player, he’s got a lot to offer.”

Priestland explains return to Wales

Rhys Priestland says playing for Wales was not the motivating factor behind him signing for Cardiff Blues.

Fly-half Priestland is returning to Wales and will join up with his new team-mates in the summer.

The current Bath No.10 has revealed his focus will be on his club side, not re-igniting his international career.

""I'm going to Cardiff because I want to play for Cardiff and I want to do well for them,"" he said to BBC Wales.

""It's not to get back and play for Wales.""

Wales coach Wayne Pivac explored the possibility of picking Priestland for this year's Six Nations but his request was rejected.

""Playing for Bath has been my only focus since coming here,"" Priestland added.

""Playing for Wales has not really been part of my thought process since I left the Scarlets and came to Bath.

""I have been involved with the Wales squad a couple of times but that has been a bonus.""

Wainright signs new Dragons deal

Wales star Aaron Wainwright has signed a new deal with the Dragons.

The 23-year-old has put pen to paper on a new contract at Rodney Parade after making 55 appearances for the region.

The back rower is currently with the Wales set-up as part of their Six Nations squad, and has so far won 28 caps for his country.

Dean Ryan, director of Dragons Rugby, said: “We’re pleased Aaron has signed a long-term deal, as we continue to retain our best homegrown talent.

“Aaron wants to bring success to his region and we’re delighted that he sees us as the ideal platform to achieve further international honours.”

He joins has fellow international Elliot Dee in committing his future to the Dragons.

A product of the Dragons Academy, Wainwright won his first international call-up for the summer tour of 2018 to USA and Argentina.

Meanwhile, Dragons centre Connor Edwards has joined English Championship side Doncaster Knights for the rest of the season.

Nigel Owens backs Rees-Zammit for Lions

Nigel Owens has backed Wales’ Louis Rees-Zammit to force his way into the British & Irish Lions reckoning this summer.

The Wales winger has been a standout performer for Wayne Pivac, bagging a brace against Scotland and impressing against England last weekend.

With head coach Warren Gatland a keen observer at the Principality Stadium last Saturday, the Gloucester flyer won’t have done his chances of a Lions call-up any harm at all.

Owens, speaking to the World Rugby website, believes Rees-Zammit has been on a “different level”.

“In this year’s Six Nations, I think as a newcomer, he’s way above everybody else,” he said.

“He’s a different level. Put your money on him going to South Africa with the Lions. I reckon, if he carries on the way he is, he’ll be on that plane… or on the bus.""

Callum Sheedy named Six Nations player of the round

Wales fly-half Callum Sheedy has been voted as the Six Nations player of round three.

Sheedy came off the bench in the second half against England, replacing the injured Dan Biggar and played a key role in Wales sealing the win over Eddie Jones' men.

Sheedy kicked three late penalties in eight second-half minutes to put Pivac's charges out of sight before his interception led to Cory Hill’s bonus-point try.

He took 32.5% of the vote, only narrowly holding off team-mate Taulupe Faletau by just 21 votes in second with 32.3%.

Ireland flanker Tadhg Beirne came third, with 22.9% of the vote, while Wales captain Alun Wyn Jones was fourth after he led from the front for his side, with 12.3%.

England star's Lions hopes hang in balance after injury blow

England lock Courtney Lawes is facing a 12-week stint on the sidelines after suffering a pectoral injury in training.

Lawes, who's since been forced to withdraw from Eddie Jones' squad, is set to go under the knife in order to rectify the problem, meaning he will miss the rest of the current Six Nations tournament, and a majority of the Premiership season with Northampton.

Saints team-mate David Ribbans has been called up to take his place in the England squad, although it remains to be seen where this setback will leave Lawes in terms of his Lions ambitions.

Lawes has played just four times since undergoing ankle surgery in October and, given the length of this latest setback, may well not play again before Gatland selects his squad.

“Northampton Saints can confirm that, following consultation between the club’s medical staff and a specialist, Courtney Lawes will undergo surgery on the pectoral injury he sustained in England training last week,” Saints said in a statement.

“The 32-year-old lock will require a rehabilitation period of approximately 12 weeks.”","Dallaglio: I've completely changed my mind on Alun Wyn JonesLawrence Dallaglio says he has completely changed his mind over Wales skipper Alun Wyn Jones and has backed him to play a big role for the Lions this summer.

A winner of a Grade 3 stakes on Jan. 2, Bob Baffert's lightly raced Life Is Good heads an outstanding field of seven sophomores going a mile and one sixteenth in Saturday's Grade 2, $300,000 San Felipe Stakes at Santa Anita.

A key prep for the Grade 1 Runhappy Santa Anita Derby on April 3, the San Felipe, which was won last year by Baffert's eventual Kentucky Derby and Breeders' Cup Classic winner Authentic, will be contested for the 83rd time, with Baffert bidding to win it for a record eighth time on Saturday.

Owned by CHC, Inc. and WinStar Farm, Life Is Good, a Kentucky-bred colt by Into Mischief out of the Distorted Humor mare Beach Walk, was making his second start in the Sham and was off as the 1-5 favorite. Although he opened up a four length advantage at the top of the lane, he narrowly held sway by three quarters of a length over stablemate Medina Spirit, who helps provide Baffert with a solid one-two punch on Saturday.

A 9 ½ length first-out maiden winner at 1-5 going 6 ½ furlongs on Nov. 22 at Del Mar, Life Is Good, a $525,000 Keeneland September Yearling, has been no secret and will likely go favored in his third start with regular rider Mike Smith up.

Baffert is also well-armed with Medina Spirit, who comes off a gutty neck win at even money in the Grade 3 Robert B. Lewis Stakes at a mile and one sixteenth on Jan. 30. A bargain $35,000 purchase at age two, Medina Spirit set a fast pace and was extra game in victory while prevailing over both Roman Centurian and highly regarded Hot Rod Charlie on the gallop out as well. A fast finishing second, beaten three quarters of length by his stablemate Life Is Good in the Grade 3 Sham on Jan. 2, Medina Spirit has shown tremendous heart in his last two races.

Owned by Zedan Racing, Stables, Inc., Medina Spirit is a Florida-bred colt by the Giant's Causeway stallion Prontonico, out of Mongolian Changa, by Brilliant Speed. A winner of two of his three starts, Medina Spirit will be ridden for the first time by eastern-based John Velazquez.

Second, beaten a nose by Baffert's Spielberg while still a maiden in the Grade 2 Los Alamitos Futurity Dec. 19, Doug O'Neill's The Great One came back to blitz maidens by 14 lengths in a one mile maiden race here on Jan. 23. A Louisiana-bred colt by O'Neill's 2016 Florida and Kentucky Derby winner Nyquist, The Great One has the benefit of ample seasoning, as he'll be making his sixth start and be going a route of ground for the fifth consecutive time.

A $185,000 purchase at age two, The Great One, who is out of the El Corredor mare Little Ms Protocol, is owned by Colorado Avalanche defenseman Erik Johnson's ERJ Racing LLC, Train Wreck Al Racing Stables, Niall J. Brennan, Tom Fritz and William Strauss and is named for NHL hockey legend Wayne Gretzky.

A big second, beaten a neck by Medina Spirit in the Grade 3 Lewis Stakes Jan. 30, Simon Callaghan's Roman Centurian, who was an impressive maiden winner at the San Felipe distance two starts back on Jan. 3, rallied from well off the pace to come up a neck short in a three-horse Robert B. Lewis photo. Tractable early, this son of Empire Maker gives every indication he'll improve with added distance as he tries a mile and one sixteenth for the third consecutive time.

Bred in Kentucky by Don Alberto Corporation, Roman Centurian is out of the Bernardini mare Spare Change. Owned by Don Alberto and Qatar Racing Limited, he'll be making his fourth start and be handled by regular rider Juan Hernandez.

Although he's only run once, Peter Eurton's Dream Shake could not have been anymore impressive in breaking his 6 ½ furlong maiden by 4 ¾ lengths here on Feb. 7. Despite the fact he was ridden by Joel Rosario, Dream Shake, a Kentucky-bred colt by Twirling Candy, was off at a whopping 20-1, but won like an odds-on favorite.

Owned by Exline-Border Racing, LLC, SAF Racing and Richard Hausman, Dream Shake, who is out of the Street Cry mare Even Song, would appear to be taking a giant leap in his second start, but he retains the services of Rosario and therefore looms a serious threat with a 96 Beyer in-hand.

Arteta issues Lacazette update

Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has admitted that he cannot rule out the prospect of striker Alexandre Lacazette leaving the club this summer.

The Frenchman is now only a few months away from entering the final 12 months of his current deal, meaning the Gunners will soon have a decision to make concerning his future.

In recent weeks, Lacazette has been linked with a move away from the Emirates Stadium, with both former club Lyon and Italian outfit Roma amongst his suitors.

Should Arsenal not be keen on offering Lacazette fresh terms, they will be eager to try and offload him this summer so that they can acquire a fee for him opposed to losing him for nothing in the final six months of his contract.

Issuing an update on his contractural status, Arteta said: ""He’s got a contract with us. He played really well the other week. It’s exactly what we demand him to do.

""I am really happy with him and the discussions about his contract will happen soon and we’ll see what happens.""

Henry waxes lyrical about Edouard

If Arsenal were to seal a move for Celtic striker Odsonne Edouard this summer it would most certainly earn the seal of approval from former striker Thierry Henry.

According to reports in the national media, Edouard has been pinpointed as a key target for the Gunners ahead of the summer transfer window, with the north London club facing the prospect of having to bolster their attacking ranks.

Should the Gunners get a deal over the line, Henry would no doubt be impressed, with former Rangers man Ally McCoist having previously revealed what the Frenchman has said about the Celtic man's talents.

McCoist told talkSPORT in 2019: ""I spoke to Thierry Henry at the Liverpool vs Leicester City game and he really rates Edouard.

""He was saying in France in particular [he's rated] and he personally really, really thinks he's got a chance of going right to the top.""

Silva has been sidelined since the 1-0 victory over Tottenham Hotspur at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium last month after being forced off with a thigh injury.

The Brazilian has recently made a return to training but the clash at Anfield will come too soon for the experienced central-defender.

Haaland blow

Chelsea's hopes of signing Borussia Dortmund striker Erling Haaland this summer have been dealt a major blow.

The Norway international, who has been in formidable form this season for the German heavyweights, has narrowed his next destination down to six possible clubs, but the Blues are not included on that list.

That is according to a report by German outlet Sport Bild, who claim the Dortmund ace has cut both Chelsea and Bayern Munich from his shortlist, narrowing his potential options down to half-a-dozen.

According to the report, Haaland only wishes to join 'an absolute top club,' suggesting Chelsea do not fall under that umbrella in the eyes of the youngster.

Atletico eye Ziyech deal

Spanish giants Atletico Madrid are looking at the possibility of signing Chelsea midfielder Hakim Ziyech this summer, according to a report by Fichajes, as cited by Sports Mole.

Ziyech joined the Blues from Dutch giants Ajax last summer in the hope of blessing Chelsea's squad with the creativity that he had continuously shown in the Netherlands.

However, it has not quite worked out for the Morocco international in west London so far, sparking speculation that he could leave the club just a year after he arrived.

Since Tuchel's arrival at Stamford Bridge in January, Ziyech has struggled for opportunities, starting just twice under the former Borussia Dortmund boss.

Recently, it was claimed that Ziyech was mulling over his future and considering leaving the club after falling out-of-favour under Tuchel.

With that in mind, it already seems unlikely that the winger will see out the duration of the five-year deal he signed.","Silva to miss Liverpool tripCentre-back Thiago Silva remains unavailable for Chelsea ahead of their clash tomorrow evening with Liverpool, head coach T homas Tuchel has confirmed.

Bale available on Thursday

Mourinho has confirmed that Gareth Bale can play again for Tottenham when they take on Fulham on Thursday.

Enduring a stop-start campaign due to injury and fitness issues following his return on loan from Real Madrid, the attacker has really caught the eye over the past two weeks.

Impressing off the bench against West Ham before scoring a sublime goal in the Europa League tie against Wolfsberger AC, Bale then hit a double as Spurs hit Burnley for four in N17 on Sunday.

Given that Spurs now having another game to contend with in a hectic schedule for the club, Mourinho feels that his player can play again but he's not entirely sure if he will start or be on the bench.

""I think so. Starting or starting on the bench I don't know,"" he said when speaking to the media at his pre-match press conference.

""He's a very experienced player. Good reaction though.""

Stoke City could move for Clarke again

Michael O'Neill has stated that Stoke City could look to bring Jack Clarke back to the club next season.

Signed on loan from Tottenham in January after only making three appearances in the Europa League and FA Cup, the winger has featured regularly for the Potters since his move to Staffordshire.

Having suffered frustrating loan spells at Leeds United and QPR last term, the 20-year-old has now got more minutes under his belt than in his previous two moves after starting four games and coming off the bench six times.

Opening up on the player's recent spell on the bench, the ex-Northern Ireland manager dropped a hint over the possibility of a longer deal for Clarke in 2021/22.

According to a press release from the Shamokin Dam Police Department, the busts both occurred Monday, March 1. According to police, during the first bust, officers and agents from the Shamokin Dam Police Department, Snyder County District Attorney’s Office, East IV Drug Task Force, and Pennsylvania Attorney General Office used a criminal informant (CI) to purchase crystal meth from target Billy Bobon.

The CI was to meet a “runner” instead of Bobon and the CI and Bobon agreed to sell 2 “eight balls” of crystal meth for $350. The CI met the “runner” and bought the crystal meth for the $350. Following the transaction, officers initiated a traffic stop on the “runner’s” vehicle and the “runners” were identified as Dawn Laubscher and Steven Filmy. Laubscher and Felmey were charged with multiple Title 35 violations. Bobon was taken into custody at his Washingtonville, PA residence. He was charged with multiple Title 35 violations.

In the second bust, officers and agents utilized a CI to buy a half-ounce of crystal meth from a person known to the CI as “Danielle”. The CI met with “Danielle” and an unknown male and bought the crystal meth for $450. After the sale, officers conducted a felony traffic stop on the male and “Danielle”. The male was identified as Wayne Kratzer and “Danielle” was identified as Danielle Cornwell. Cornwell suffered a medical emergency while in custody in the police cruiser when the lights were turned on.

Kratzer was charged with multiple Title 35 violations and was taken to Snyder County Prison. An arrest warrant was obtained for Cornwell, who will also be facing multiple Title 35 violations. A search warrant was executed on their vehicle and an additional ounce of crystal meth was located in the vehicle.

DANVILLE, MONTOUR COUNTY (WBRE/WYOU-TV) — Geisinger is alerting patients about scammers that are posing as COVID vaccine schedulers. A Geisinger representative says the scammers are reaching out to Geisinger patients by automated calls, live callers and/or text messages. The fraudulent activity includes the scammers asking for the patient’s name, date of birth and Social Security number in order to schedule a vaccine appointment. They say patients and the community should be aware that Geisinger will never ask for a Social Security number and if you do get a suspicious call, you should hang up and call Geisinger directly at 800-275-6401 or check your myGeisinger account for messages.","SHAMOKIN DAM, SNYDER COUNTY (WBRE/WYOU) — Five people face charges after two separate drug busts in Snyder County.

3 days ago,mlive.com,Clash of conference titans headlines Tuesday’s Kalamazoo-area prep hoops action,"KALAMAZOO, MI - The second half of Michigan’s high school basketball season is underway, meaning conference championships will be decided over the next three weeks.

Four contests around Kalamazoo held huge league title implications on Tuesday, and just about all of them lived up to the hype.

In Battle Creek, a pair of the state’s top senior girls basketball players battled it out, as Kalamazoo Central’s Morasha Wiggins took her 5-1 Maroon Giants to Lakeview for a matchup with Brazyll Watkins and the undefeated Spartans.

In the end, it was the Maroon Giants’ Miss Basketball candidate that carried her team to victory, with Wiggins tallying 31 points, seven rebounds and six assists in K-Central’s 59-51 win.

Watkins finished with 28 to lead the Spartans, which fell to 8-1 overall and 4-1 in the SMAC East.

K-Central improved to 6-1 and 5-0 in the league, and the Maroon Giants have another tough test against Mattawan (6-1) coming up on Thursday.

The K-Central boys also had a SMAC East showdown with Lakeview, but this one wasn’t as close, as the red-hot Maroon Giants ran away with a 71-53 win thanks to 17 points, including five 3-pointers, from sophomore big man Hutch Ward. Senior forward Gerald Crawford, junior point guard Scott Hughes and junior wing Thomas Dillard chipped in 13 points apiece for K-Central (6-1), which has won six consecutive games and holds a one-game lead over Gull Lake in the conference standings.

Lakeview is now 5-2 and sits at third in the SMAC East.

In the SCAA, the Climax-Scotts boys stayed undefeated after a 56-50 win over Colon, which entered the game at 5-1 overall and 3-1 in the league.

Junior Jackson Lawrence led the way with 21 points and nine rebounds, while Lance Smith added 11 points to help the Panthers move to 6-0 on the year.

The Climax-Scotts girls also had a conference showdown with Colon, but the Panther girls weren’t as fortunate as the boys, as the Magi escaped with a 42-40 win behind nine points from Reese Williams.

Briana Butler led Climax-Scotts with 14 points and five assists, while Maddie Edwards added nine points and 12 rebounds.

Those key conference games weren’t the only notable finishes during a busy night of high school basketball, so follow along for more scores, stats and highlights from around Kalamazoo.

K-Christian’s defense dominates in rivalry win over Hackett

Kalamazoo Christian and Kalamazoo Hackett are both playing catch-up with Schoolcraft in the SAC Valley standings, but the Comets and the Irish could be playing pick-up ball on the playground, and the intensity would be palpable.

Tuesday’s matchup was a defensive slugfest between the two rivals, with K-Christian holding Hackett to a season-low point total in the Comets’ 47-35 win.

“We can score a lot of points, and we have some guys that can fill it up, but we really try to focus heavily on defense and switching it up quite often,” K-Christian coach Brennan Davis said. “Our defense turned into a lot of offense for us, so that was helpful.

“We’ve preached defense because know we can score, but if we can stop teams from scoring, it’s going to keep us in every game.”

Sophomore guard J.J. Manion led K-Christian with 12 points, including eight in a first quarter that saw the Comets jump out to a 15-9 lead. Jack Szczseny and Chris Terpstra each added eight points, and Jared Scheffers chipped in five.

Hackett’s Logan St. Martin led all scorers with 16 points, but K-Christian held everyone else on the Irish’s roster to six points or fewer.

“Tonight, we went out and had tough team defense and limited their second-chance points. That was the key to our win,” Scheffers said. “One of our strengths as a team this year is our hard work and defense.”

Hackett falls to 5-3 overall and 4-3 in the SAC Valley, while K-Christian improves to 7-2 overall and 5-2 in the league, with the Comets’ two losses coming in an overtime heartbreaker to Delton Kellogg and a close contest with undefeated Schoolcraft.

K-Christian closes out its week with Constantine on Friday and Portage Northern on Saturday in an interesting matchup between the Division 1 Huskies and the Division 3 Comets.

“The team’s defensive mentality is to always out-work the opponent, no matter who they are,” K-Christian’s Terpstra said. “Being strong defensively really encourages the whole team.”

Here are the standouts from the past week:

Caitlin Clark, Iowa

Showing no signs of slowing down during her standout freshman season, Iowa’s Caitlin Clark averaged 26.3 points, 10 assists, and five rebounds, added three blocks, three steals, and was a perfect 10-for-10 from the free-throw line as the Hawkeye went 2-1 during a busy week.

Against No. 8 Maryland on Feb. 23, Clark posted 29 points in the first half to break the program’s all-time freshman scoring record. She finished the game with 34 points, marking her fifth consecutive and NCAA-leading ninth game this season scoring 30-or-more points. Her nine 30-point games are believed to be the most by an NCAA Division I freshman since 2000. Clark made a career-best nine 3-pointers, the most for a Hawkeye since Melissa Dixon registered nine at Northwestern on Jan. 29, 2015. Clark finished the game with seven assists, three rebounds, and a steal.

After a five-hour delay, Clark led the Hawkeyes to an 89-67 win over 12th-ranked Michigan on Feb. 25. The West Des Moines, Iowa, native netted 27 points, dished out nine assists and grabbed five rebounds. She was 7-for-12 (.583) from 3-point range and 10-for-17 (.588) from the field.

In Iowa’s final game of the week, an 84-70 win at Wisconsin on Feb. 28, Clark recorded her seventh double-double of the season, knocking down 18 points and dishing out a career-high 14 assists. Clark broke the Iowa women’s basketball all-time freshman assist record. She has 149 on the season, surpassing former Hawkeye Kathleen Doyle, who recorded 148 during the 2016-17 season. Clark added seven rebounds, two blocks and a steal.

Clark leads the nation in total points, recording 564 on the season. She ranks second in assists (149), assists per game (7.1), points per game (26.9), 3-pointers made (82), triple-doubles (1), and 3-point field goal attempts (202).

She ranks in the top-50, nationally, in seven additional statistical categories, including third in field goals made (188) and 3-pointers per game (3.9), eighth in field goal attempts (394), 17th in free throws made (106), 28th in free throw attempts (125), 44th in 3-point percentage (40.6), and 45th in free-throw percentage (84.8).

The Hawkeyes, 14-7 overall and 10-7 in Big Ten play will next travel to Indiana on March 3.

TOP 16: One thing to know about every team in the latest Top 16

Daryn Hickok, Weber State

Weber State's Daryn Hickok averaged 25 points, seven rebounds and two steals per game and shot 62 percent from the field in leading Weber State to two home wins last week over Sacramento State.

Hickok scored 25 points and grabbed seven rebounds in both games. She was 9 of 13 from the field and 6 of 6 from the free-throw line in Thursday's 79-73 win over the Hornets.

She followed that up with 25 points, seven rebounds, three steals and two blocks while shooting 9 of 16 from the field and 5 of 6 from the free-throw line in Saturday's 75-69 overtime win over the Hornets.

For the two games, she was 18 of 29 from the field and 11 of 12 from the free-throw line.

On the season, the Portland, Oregon native leads the Wildcats in scoring at 12.3 points per game.

Weber State, 2-17 overall and 2-14 in Big Sky Conference games, closes out the regular season with games at Northern Colorado on March 3 and 5 before the Big Sky Tournament begins next Monday.

Lauren Park-Lane, Seton Hall

Seton Hall sophomore Lauren Park-Lane was instrumental in the Pirates' success in a pair of road victories last week, averaging 18.5 points and 10.0 assists per game in wins over Xavier and Villanova.

On Monday, March 1, Seton Hall won its fifth straight game, this time over St. John’s (NY) 59-43, as Desiree Elmore erupted for a career-high 30 points and Park-Lane backed her with 13 points of her own.

On Feb. 24 at Xavier, Park-Lane recorded her first career double-double, scoring 17 points and dishing out a career-high 15 assists as the Pirates rolled to a 108-65 win. Her 15 assists broke Seton Hall's single-game record that stood for 25 years. On Saturday at Villanova, Park-Lane reached 20 points for the fifth time this season to go with five more assists as Seton Hall won 67-55.

For the season, Park-Lane is averaging 17.4 points per game and has now dished out 101 assists (5.6 per game) to lead the Pirates. Seton Hall, 14-6 overall and 12-5 in Big East Conference play, will enter the upcoming Big East Tournament as the No. 3 seed. The Pirates will play the winner of the No. 6 Creighton vs. No. 11 Georgetown game on Saturday, March 6.

Taylor Robertson, Oklahoma

Playing its best basketball of the season over the last week, Oklahoma has won three straight games behind the strong play of guard Taylor Robertson.

Robertson averaged 21.0 points per game and shot 52.0% (13-for-25) in two Sooner wins last week over TCU and Texas, then had 16 points on Monday in a victory over Texas Tech.

In the 76-60 win at TCU on Feb. 24, Robertson scored a season-high 28 points on 10-for-16 shooting, including six made 3-pointers. The junior also pulled down five rebounds and added three steals at TCU.

In the 69-63 overtime win at Texas on Feb. 27, Robertson scored 14 points and connected on 6-of-6 from the free-throw line.

The Sooners then defeated Texas Tech 88-79 on March 1. As part of her 16 points, Robertson connected on seven of eight free throws. The one miss at the charity stripe was her first miss of the season, as she has now connected on 50 of 51 free throws in 2020-21 (98.0 percent).

The Sooners, 11-10 overall and 8-8 in Big 12 Conference play, are home for the last two games of the regular season, hosting TCU on March 4 and Kansas State on March 7.

IImar'I Thomas, Cincinnati

Cincinnati senior forward IImar'I Thomas scored a school and conference-record 51 points on 20-of-27 shooting from the field and 11-of-13 shooting from the free-throw line to go with 12 rebounds and four assists in a 76-61 win at East Carolina last Wednesday.

The effort marks the most points scored by a men's or women's basketball player this season. She also joined Oscar Robertson as the only two players in Cincinnati history to score at least 50 points in a game. Robertson achieved the feat six times, the last coming against North Texas on Feb. 22, 1960, when he scored a men's program school-record 62 points.

With the feat, Thomas surpassed 1,800 career points to become the only player in school history to tally at least 1,800 career points and 800 career rebounds.

Thomas followed that performance by scoring a game-high 28 points on 8-of-14 shooting from the floor and 12-of-15 shooting from the foul line to go with nine rebounds and three blocks during a 71-58 win at Tulsa on Saturday.

For the week, Thomas averaged 39.5 points and 10.5 rebounds while shooting 68.3 percent from the field and 82.1 percent from the free-throw line.

Thomas is averaging 23.6 points, 7.7 rebounds and 3.4 assists while averaging 39.3 minutes this season. She has scored 30 or more points four times and 20 or more points in 15 games in 2020-21. She has played 38 or more minutes in 17 of 21 games this season and 40 or more minutes 11 times.

Thomas enters the week ranked among the nation's top 30 in seven categories for 2020-21, including points per game (seventh at 23.6), minutes played per game (second at 39.3), field goals made (fifth at 185), total points (seventh at 496), free throws made (10th at 117), free throws attempted (15th at 144), field goal percentage (25th at .544) and field goal attempts (28th at 340).

Cincinnati, 6-15 overall and 5-11 in American Athletic Conference play, closed the regular season with a March 2 game at Houston.","She finished the game with 34 points, marking her fifth consecutive and NCAA-leading ninth game this season scoring 30-or-more points.

3 days ago,A Sea of Blue,Wednesday Headlines: Worst Two-Point Shooting Team in America? Edition,"John Calipari had an interesting quote following Kentucky’s loss to Ole Miss last night.

Calipari on Postgame Radio:



“This is a stat our fans may know or may not know. We may be the worst two point shooting team in America” — Matt Jones (@KySportsRadio) March 3, 2021

I’m not sure if this is statistically accurate or not, but just from the eyeball test, it wouldn’t be surprising.

Last night, Kentucky shot 44.4 percent on two-point shots (16/36).

According to teamrankings.com , Kentucky ranks 311/347 for two-point field goal percentage at 45.5 percent. For reference, Gonzaga ranks first at 64.4 percent.

This season, game after game, time after time, we’ve watched missed layups that have left us scratching our heads wondering how that shot could be missed. We’ve watched players pull up for long two-pointers when they could take a three by shooting from one step further back. We’ve watched contested mid-range jumpers that nobody had any business taking.

The list goes on and on.

It all points to an offense that is not effective, to put it nicely, and a system that needs changing.

As for the two-point shooting, I think fans know just how bad it is.

History of NFL teams trading first-round draft picks for veterans: Winners, losers from last five years

March 13, 2019: Browns-Giants Browns acquire WR Odell Beckham Jr., EDGE Olivier Vernon Giants acquire 2019 first-round pick, 2019 third-round pick, S Jabrill Peppers, OG Kevin Zeitler Browns’ win-loss record since trade and furthest advancement: 17-15 (AFC Divisional Round) Giants’ win-loss record since trade and furthest advancement: 10-22 It is hard to declare anyone a winner in this deal. The Browns did win their first playoff game since the 1990s, but Beckham had been injured for awhile. It does not appear that any player exchanged in this deal will be a high-level performer for their new team in the long-term.

While neither team is truly a “clear winner” as writer Josh Edwards puts it, the Giants certainly got more from the trade than the Browns did. Beckham has been inconsistent with the Browns, posting mediocre numbers (by his incredible standards) in two years and is now coming off an ACL tear and could be on the move. Vernon saw more success in 2020, nearly racking up double digit sack numbers before a torn Achilles ended his season.

Meanwhile, the 2019 first round pick that became Dexter Lawrence has proven to be a solid investment by the Giants, and Jabrill Peppers continues to show flashes. So while the Browns are definitely the better team, the Giants must be happy with the return they got.

3 days ago,KPCW,"Amid Positive Headlines, Summit County's COVID-19 Transmission Rate Remains 'High'","Listen to this story as it aired on KPCW 91.7

Summit County’s Health Director says the county is seeing some positive trends in the pandemic with the arrival of vaccines and a decline in cases. But Rich Bullough said citizens still need to be cautious.

Health Board Chairman Chris Cherniak noted that they were meeting almost a year to the day from the time the Board received its first briefing on a new virus the World Health Organization was calling Coronavirus Disease 2019.

Rich Bullough reported that as of Monday, the county had just passed 5,000 total cases. It has recorded 147 hospitalizations. And the 14-day number is 163 cases, meaning the county is still in the High Transmission Index and will be for some time.

He said the county has now recorded nine deaths. He said they just received word of the latest fatality, a male approximately 50 years old. Health officials said the death occurred in December, and the medical examiner’s office had just reported it as a Covid death.

Still, he said the number is relatively low.

“And we’re very fortunate,” Bullough said. “But part of the reason we’ve escaped the higher number of deaths is because our hospital system has been able to maintain capacity. So I just want to remind people we’re not there yet.”

He said recent case numbers have been a little uneven. After an extended decline from the first of the year, they saw growth for five days. But he said as of Monday, they were on a plateau.

Health Board Member Doug Evans noted that even though they’re on a plateau, that level is higher than the peak they saw in the summer. He said they want to see the case numbers more like last September’s, about half of the current plateau.

Bullough said that other health officials in the state, the nation and around the globe are concerned that citizens are easing off a little too soon. He said residents should continue to wear a mask, maintain social distancing, and limit social gatherings.

He said they didn’t see a surge from the weekend of the Super Bowl, when many residents gather in homes, so it’s likely locals were prudent and didn’t have big parties. Bullough said it’s too soon to tell if there were any impacts from the Valentine’s and President’s Day period.

He said in terms of positivity numbers, the county is doing enormously well.

“We were, for a long stretch of time, one of the three lowest counties in the state,” he said. “That is, in part, kudos to everybody doing tests. I used to only say Intermountain, but Phil Bondurant and others have implemented the business-testing program. We’ve got multiple-testing partners in the community now. Schools are doing a ton of testing. All of those data are reported. So these numbers are reflective of very high volume of testing. And the target is about 5 percent, which is right about where we are.”

Bullough added that the local school districts have also done well.

“Their biggest challenge was when they were not in the school environment over the holidays, and when individuals and the students came back, Park City School District exceeded the threshold and they were challenged,” he said. “But they did massive testing. All three districts have been testing. Park City, they tested every student, and they found very, very low rates of infection. So the school districts have done really, really well. And we’ve been fortunate. In some ways, I’d like to say we’re an outlier and that we’re just better than everybody else. But the reality of it is there’s been relatively little spread in schools nation-wide if mitigation measures are in place. Where masks aren’t worn, and school is just being held as normal, the outbreaks go through the roof. But that has not been the case in Summit County. They’ve done a great job.”","Rich Bullough reported that as of Monday, the county had just passed 5,000 total cases.

3 days ago,Rock Paper Shotgun,Control and XCOM: Chimera Squad headline Humble Choice for March,"Humble have announced the latest batch of games coming to their monthly subscription service Humble Choice this evening, and March's bundle looks to be one of the best in quite a while. Not only is it headlined by Remedy's excellent telekinetic shooter Control, but it's also joined by XCOM: Chimera Squad and indie side-scrolling strategy game Kingdom Two Crowns to name just a few of the games appearing in the 12-strong bundle. That's over $260 worth of games for just £9 / $12.

You'll need to have an active Humble Choice subscription to take advantage of the bundle (you can sign up here or use the link below if you don't), but it's probably worth doing for Control alone if you haven't got round to playing it yet, as this is definitely the lowest price I've seen for it since it first came out in 2019. After all, the beauty of Humble Choice is that you're not locked in for a set amount of time, and you can cancel your subscription straight away if you just want to sign up for a month to get a particular set of games. You don't lose access to your Choice games, either, as they're for keeps forever regardless of whether you have an active subscription or not.

In case you're unfamiliar with Humble Choice, here's a quick reminder of how it works. There are three different price tiers to choose from (Lite, Basic and Premium), but you'll need to be on the Basic or Premium tiers to get the monthly subscription games. Basic lets you pick a total of three games every month, while Premium gets you nine of them. As mentioned above, though, they're yours to keep forever once they've been redeemed, and you can cancel your subscription at any time.

The top Premium tier is actually the best value one at time of writing, as Humble currently have another on for new subscribers that lets you lock in 12 months for $12 / month - a saving of 40% off its usual price. What's more, new Premium members can get all 12 games this month until April 6th, bagging you three extra games compared to what you'd normally get.

Of course, I should also note that Control did come to Xbox Game Pass for PC last month as well, so Game Pass subscribers should probably check it out there instead unless you're particularly adamant about having your own copy of it.","Humble have announced the latest batch of games coming to their monthly subscription service Humble Choice this evening, and March's bundle looks to be one of the best in quite a while.

The NBA reportedly had issues finding players to take part in the normal festivities. Yahoo! Sports' Chris Haynes reported Tuesday that notable players such as Brown, Anthony Edwards and Miles Bridges all turned down an invite to the Slam Dunk Contest, while LaMelo Ball declined to be in the Skills Challenge.

Spurs linked with Vazquez

Tottenham have been linked with a move for Real Madrid forward Lucas Vazquez.

According to the Daily Star, Spurs could be interested in the winger having been linked with him both in the winter and summer.

Vazquez looks set to become a free agent this summer having reportedly rejected a new contract despite featuring regularly this season with 16 league starts.

The 29-year-old came through the Real Madrid academy but now looks set to depart, opening the door for Jose Mourinho to snap up the Spaniard.

Winks could get transfer wish

Harry Winks could get his wish this summer after reportedly deciding on his next move.

Reduced time on the pitch could see Winks seek a summer exit from North London, and it was reported in February that he would like the opportunity to play in Spain.

Spanish publication Sport claimed Winks is one of the Premier League players who would like to play in La Liga and one of the players with the possibility of following former teammate Kieran Tripper to Spain.

Winks has Spanish ancestry through his grandparents and he did once say: ""I've got Spanish grandparents and I've got a connection with Spain,"" when asked whether he would represent England and Spain at international level.

That's because La Liga outfit Valencia are fans of Winks and a change at the Mestalla club could put them in position to sign the midfielder.

According to reports, Valencia had a loan bid for Winks rejected during the January transfer window, but they could yet make a permanent or another loan move for the 25-year-old.

Sutton slams Bale

The common consensus is that Gareth Bale is back.

For former Chelsea striker Chris Sutton, however, it is too little too late.

Speaking on BBC Five Live's Monday Night Club, Sutton raged at Bale, blaming the player for his lack of game time at Spurs, labelling him a ""bitter disappointment"".

Sutton said: ""It's Gareth Bale's fault [he hasn't started more]. Jose Mourinho's comment tells us everything - when Gareth Bale is fit he gets in any team in the world.

""Remember when Gareth Bale signed for Spurs everyone was talking about do Spurs have the best frontline in the Premier League? Gareth Bale has taken too long to get himself in condition. If you're a Spurs fan you'd have wanted him fit and flying long before now.

""You can't tell me a fit and flying Gareth Bale wouldn't be a major asset for Jose Mourinho and if he was fit and flying Jose Mourinho would leave him out of the team? Of course he'd be in the team.

""There's an argument he's lost his hunger for the game, we all know he has been a world class player and it was so exciting when he signed for Spurs, but Spurs haven't got the best out of him.

""Whether it's desire issues, maybe he has to be finely tuned and maybe he gets his confidence when he's 100% fit. But how long does it take to get fit for heaven's sake? It's not been good enough.""

4 days ago,Big Blue View,"Giants news, 3/2: Xavier McKinney, Leonard Williams, Samson Ebukam, more headlines","Good morning, New York Giants fans!

NFL second-year players set to make a 2021 leap

In his assessment of last season’s rookies, CBS Sports writer Josh Edwards named former second-round pick Xavier McKinney as one of his Year 2 breakout stars:

Xavier McKinney, NYG FS, #29 McKinney was my top-rated safety in last year’s draft so I am bullish, perhaps stubborn, in regards to his potential. The former Alabama defensive back missed 11 games, but ended the season on a high note with an interception against Dallas. One would think upgrading the pass rush is a priority for the Giants this offseason, and that only means more turnover opportunities for McKinney.

McKinney’s solid play when healthy, to the tune of a 70.0 PFF grade as a rookie, has made him an exciting player going into his second year as a pro. A full season in defensive coordinator Patrick Graham’s system will hopefully show off McKinney’s versatility and capabilities.

NY Giants must prioritize signing Leonard Williams to a long-term contract

Hardly anyone who watched the Giants last season would disagree, but Fansided’s Matt Lombardo spells out why the Giants should make Leonard Williams the top free agent priority.

New York Giants Potential Free Agent Target: OLB Samson Ebukam

Giants Country writer Patricia Traina details why she believes the Giants should be in the running for the 25-year-old EDGE from the L.A. Rams. With five sacks in each of the last two seasons, the 2017 fourth-round pick will likely command a smaller price tag than other EDGE players like Haason Reddick. Do you think Ebukam is a good fit with the Giants?

4 days ago,Streetsblog New York,Tuesday’s Headlines: Open Culture is Here Edition,"Tuesday’s Headlines: Open Culture is Here Edition

You heard the man. When he wasn’t gloating about the political abyss into which Gov. Cuomo has fallen, Mayor de Blasio was touting his open culture program, which began taking applications yesterday (click here to apply — if, that is, you’re a cultural organization; this program isn’t for amateurs).

It’s still a little unclear how this is all going to work: The city has set aside about 100 street segments as “Open Culture” zones — and arts groups can apply for the space, and even charge for tickets. But obviously passers-by will be able to gawk for free from the street. And it’s unclear if the city will match up producers and/or venues with the open street segment closest to them. (Bedford+Bowery covered.)

Still, artists are excited. We spoke to Meghan Finn of The Tank, which is accepting submissions here, though the theater group isn’t yet sure where its open culture street performances will be.

“It’s going to be a magical summer,” she said. “People are starving for live performances.”

Of course, there are logistical concerns: The street segments in Manhattan will likely have lots of applications, given how many performance organizations are based in the theater capital of the world. “It may be like an Oklahoma land rush to get the space you want,” Finn said.

And obviously small theater groups are anxious that Lincoln Center doesn’t just book all the streets around its facility and that open culture doesn’t have some of the inequitable elements of the open streets program.

“We can’t just have performances in affluent neighborhoods,” said Finn, who was extremely optimistic everything would be worked out.

“The people want it and they will seek it out,” she said.

Meanwhile, a big hat tip goes out to the Rockwell Group and national treasure starchitect David Rockwell, who is working with TAIT and three venues to create an easy-to-set-up and easy-to-staff 50-seat street venue (amNY covered it, but we got the pics, too. Check them out in our slideshow below).

This slideshow requires JavaScript.

Other than that, it was a slow day unless you were on the Cuomo beat.

Not enough mainstream outlets covered Transportation Alternatives’s big demand that mayoral candidates commit to clawing back 25 percent of all the space commandeered by cars. We covered it, of course, and Mark Hallum of amNY gave it a nice spin. Patch’s coverage had a romantic photo. Gothamist also wrote it up.

Guse of the Newsuh savaged Andrew Yang for tweeting about riding a “Bronx-bound” A train, which is a physical impossibility. But let’s not forget: Yang was on the subway, which is more than we can say for most candidates.

Mayor de Blasio turned the switch back on roughly 1,700 capital projects yesterday, but when we asked the Department of Transportation and City Hall for a list so we could inform our readers what to expect, all we heard was crickets. (NY Post, amNY)

A great reporter, Beth Fertig, had a nice deep dive on restaurant deliveries and what a screwed up system it is. (WNYC)

The also-great Jose Martinez did an interesting story for The City about New Yorkers who have given up the subway for good. We hope it’s not true!

Just when Brad Lander thought it was safe to print up Comptroller’s office stationery, Corey Johnson jumped into the race for the city’s top bean counter. (NY Post)

Who ya gonna call?

Bale is Back

Tottenham put in a terrific performance on Sunday afternoon to defeat Burnley 4-0 with Gareth Bale the star of the show and roundly praised for returning to the form that saw him become the world's most expensive football player.

Bale netted twice, the second a beautiful left-footed effort, provided the assist for Harry Kane's goal, and put in an all-round excellent performance in just his third Premier League start of the season.

There was one moment in the first-half that saw Bale roll back the years.

Faced up against Charlie Taylor, Bale knocked the ball one side of the Burnley man before sprinting down the touchline and collecting the ball before Taylor had even had time to turn.

It was reminiscent of his Copa Del Rey final goal for Real Madrid against Barcelona in 2014 and proff his confidence as well as form is well and truly back.

Four into one does not go

The return of Bale to his scintillating best is good news for Tottenham Hotspurs and Jose Mourinho, however, for four Spurs players, it makes their chances of getting into the side that much harder.

With Bale proving himself undroppable alongside first-choice starters Harry Kane and Son Heung-min that only leaves one spot in attacking midfield left available if Mourinho continues with his 4-2-3-1 formation.

Lucas Moura is the man in possession of the shirt and put in a fine performance himself against Burnley.

The Brazilian scored Tottenham's third goal of the afternoon and netted the weekend before in the 2-1 defeat to West Ham. but there are three other men vying for his shirt in the starting XI

Spurs given derby boost by UEFA

Currently, Tottenham and Arsenal are both due to be playing the first-legs of their round of 16 Europa League clashes away from home on March 11 with the home legs taking place the following week.

The north London derby is sandwiched between these two legs and the order of Spurs' tie could be rescheduled according to a report in the Evening Standard, to avoid both teams having a home match on the same evening.

(Image: GLYN KIRK/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)

If that is the case Arsenal as FA Cup winners are likely to be given the advantage of having their home leg second while Mourinho's men will lose that advantage.

One positive from this for Tottenham is that in the lead up to the derby they will no longer face a trip to Croatia but will instead be hosting Dinamo Zagreb at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.

Arsenal, meanwhile, will be completing a 3,000 mile round trip to Greece once more to take on Olympiakos, just 68 hours before hosting Spurs.","Here are the Tottenham evening headlines for Monday March 1, 2021.

Keane makes Mount comparison

Former Manchester United midfielder Roy Keane has compared Chelsea ace Mason Mount with fellow former United man Paul Scholes.

Keane made the admission following Chelsea's goalless draw with the Red Devils on Sunday at Stamford Bridge.

Mount has experienced a rapid rise in recent years, jumping from a Championship loanee to a fully fledged England international in less than two years. Although he still has a lot of hard work ahead of him, he has already proven himself to be a key member in Thomas Tuchel's plans at Stamford Bridge, following the German's arrival back in January.

Speaking to Sky Sports, Keane said: ""We’ve been praising this lad now for the last number of years, the way he plays the game, almost like Paul Scholes, plays like a kid on the street, it all comes very easy for him.

""Good first touch, seems an honest kid, he has a goal in him, he has an assist.

""There’s no surprise this lad is playing, when the manager came he would have had a look at him before.""

Makelele sends message to Kante

Former Chelsea midfield ace Claude Makelele insists N'Golo Kante can do more to help the Blues' offensive players as they look to try and increase their goals tally in the weeks and months that lie ahead.

The France international, who has helped the Blues win three trophies since making the switch to Stamford Bridge from Leicester City back in 2016, started for just the second time in the Premier League under Tuchel on Sunday, with his only other Premier League start, since the German took over, coming against Southampton last weekend.

Although Kante has been one of Chelsea's star players over the last few years, Makelele, who spent five years as a player in west London, has admitted that he ""expects more"" from his performances moving forward.

“For me, I expect more from N’Golo Kante because he can be better than me,” Makelele said on Chelsea’s Matchday Live show. “He needs more communication with his defenders.

""You want him to have more responsibility, more power to say: ‘I’m here. You do this behind me and I’ll do this in front of you’. He can have leadership in this team. I know Kante is shy, never talks, he just wants to do his job. But I think he can do more.”

Shearer heaps praise on Gunners after Foxes triumph

Match of the Day pundit Alan Shearer has heaped praise on Arsenal's pressing game following Sunday afternoon's 3-1 win over Leicester City at the King Power Stadium.

The Gunners, who have now won two of their last three Premier League outings, recovered from 1-0 down thanks to goals from David Luiz, Alexandre Lacazette and Nicolas Pepe, ensuring Mikel Arteta's side secured a second win in just a matter of days, following Thursday evening's Europa League heroics against Benfica.

Although it was Pepe's return to the scoresheet and Willian's brace of assists that dominated the post-match talking points, former Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United striker Shearer waxed lyrical about the way Arsenal's players pressed and worked Brendan Rodgers' Foxes.

""What was evident was their pressing,"" Shearer told BBC Sport. ""They went after Leicester. They were all on the same page, they showed great character from coming back from a goal down, it didn’t change their attitude.

""They pressed in threes and fours and constantly won the ball back. It didn’t change second half, they chose when to go and then went with energy.

""If they don’t win the first one, they win the second. Some big performances from Willian and Pepe.

""That’s what’s let them down this season (consistency). Too many times this season, I think they can go on and build from that performance today.""

Arteta update

Barcelona have not held any discussions with Arsenal about the prospect of them trying to poach Arteta, football.london understands.

Reports in the national media over the weekend had claimed that the La Liga giants were keen on pursuing a move for the Spaniard, should Ronald Koeman be shown the door at the Nou Camp.

However, there has been no formal approach or discussions held between the two clubs, meaning Arsenal are not any immediate danger of losing their manager.

Although Barcelona have not directly made contact with Arsenal about prizing Arteta away, that is not to say that the Spanish club are not admirers of the work he has done during his relatively short managerial career so far.

5 days ago,Berkeleyside,Jonathan and Jesse Kellermans' books ripped from Berkeley headlines.,"‘Half Moon Bay,’ by the father and son duo, is just one of hundreds of novels published in the past few decades that have been set in Berkeley.

“On a damp Saturday, just last year, the sixties died in Berkeley.

On Sunday, I came for the bones.”

That’s the opening for Half Moon Bay, the new crime thriller featuring Alameda County Deputy Sheriff Clay Edison written by the father-and-son team Jonathan and Jesse Kellerman.

The opening pages seem ripped from the headlines. In the novel, UC Berkeley has just erected a chain-link fence around People’s Park which promptly “had been scaled, sheared open, knocked down.” The protest and vandalism came as demonstrators tried to stop the university from erecting student housing in the park.

Those exact events happened for the first time in January, but the Kellermans wrote their story years ago. Half Moon Bay was published in July.

“Everything we are seeing now is described in the first pages of the book,” said Jesse Kellerman, who lives in Berkeley (his father lives in Los Angeles).

Including the turmoil around People’s Park in the third book of the Clay Edison crime series was a no-brainer, said Kellerman. As a writer, he is always on the lookout for dramatic situations and interesting people he can incorporate into his work. Berkeley, with its citizen activists, protest culture, and certified flashpoints involving the university, development, and fights for the rights of people, including Blacks and the Ohlone, is always good fodder.

“You don’t have to be a prophet to know that the minute Cal does something concrete toward putting up a building there and demolishing the park that people are going to be distressed, that some contingent is going to push back,” said the younger Kellerman.

What books set in Berkeley have you read and enjoyed? Let us know in the comments.

Half Moon Bay is just one of the hundreds of novels that include Berkeley as a setting. For decades, writers have used the city and its events as plot lines. Isabel Allende set her 2013 novel, Maya’s Notebook, largely in Berkeley. Anthony Boucher set several of his science fiction tales in the city. Susan Dunlap’s crime series features Jill Smith, a Berkeley detective. Jack Kerouac’s Dharma Bums has Berkeley scenes as does April Sinclair’s Ain’t Gonna Be the Same Fool Twice. Many children’s books take place in Berkeley, including Beverly Cleary’s Mitch and Amy and Hope Alper’s The Chanukah Bears of Marin Circle, among others.

There is no tally of how many books have been set in Berkeley but enough have been that the Berkeley Public Library keeps a running list of such books. (It features more than 200 and was last updated in 2012). Randal Brandt, head of cataloging at the UC Berkeley Library, has curated a list of mysteries set in the Bay Area and there are more than 2,500. He believes 115 mysteries have been set here. Berkeleyside also regularly runs features about books with a Berkeley connection.

Sometimes Berkeley’s liberal values are highlighted, not just its parks and sidewalks, as was the case in Shanthi Sekaran’s Lucky Boy. The 2017 novel tells the story of an undocumented immigrant from Mexico who goes to work for a wealthy, liberal Berkeley family. When she is targeted for deportation, the family takes in her infant son and complications ensue. “Lucky Boy is set in Berkeley, and told with warmth and empathy, but with a keen eye for the sometimes well-meaning delusions of the privileged,” Marthine Satris wrote in a Berkeleyside Q&A with the author.

“I think that Berkeley is a very particular place in that it’s filled with people with excellent intentions,” said Sekaran. “People want the best for everyone: for immigrants, for nonimmigrants, for undocumented immigrants. But it’s also a place of great privilege, and sometimes those two elements don’t mix; sometimes people’s good intentions blind them to their own insensitivities.”

When the Kellerman duo sets out to create a new mystery series (Jonathan, who has published nearly 60 books is best known for his series featuring Alex Delaware. Jesse has published more than 10 books. Faye Kellerman, Jonathan’s wife and Jesse’s mother is also a very accomplished novelist) they knew they wanted to make the East Bay the setting, a locale the Kellermans believe is underrepresented in contemporary literature.

“The East Bay is a place that has gotten some literary attention but, in my opinion, not enough attention, and actually in the thriller genre very, very little,” said Jesse Kellerman. “We try to move the lens around to different spots in the East Bay. Not so much San Francisco because that has its own noir history. We don’t need to retread that. But everything else, Oakland, Berkeley, Alameda, all the outlying areas, Livermore, even down on the Peninsula – places that have not gotten enough attention.”

The other Clay Edison books (Crime Scene, A Measure of Darkness) were set partly in Berkeley and partly around other East Bay locales. But Jesse Kellerman wanted Half Moon Bay to center on where he lives.

“I wanted this to be an intensely Berkeley-focused book because I live here too,” said Kellerman who moved here to be with his wife, who grew up in Berkeley. The couple has three young children. “I wanted to drill down to the very core of what makes Berkeley, Berkeley. I’m invested in this place.”

And People’s Park is an epicenter of Berkeley, so it makes sense to set a book there, said Kellerman. He was quick to point out that the park is not the only epicenter of Berkeley but one of many.

How does a novelist take ideas or events that are swirling around and put them into prose?

It’s not a linear process, said Kellerman. He looks at true events and draws out elements he think would be interesting to readers.

For example, Jonathan Kellerman collects old copies of True Detective Magazine and sends issue with Northern California events to his son. One issue that caught Jesse Kellerman’s attention was from November 1955. It told the story of Stephanie Bryan, a 13-year-old girl who disappeared while walking up the stairs behind the Claremont Hotel. Her disappearance launched the biggest manhunt in Berkeley history. Tragically, her body was later found. Her murder shattered many Berkeley residents’ notion that they lived in a safe community.

“I’d never heard of this case before I read this, which is kind of incredible because she disappeared from a spot maybe 500 yards from my house, very very close to where I live,” said Kellerman.

The disappearance of 13-year-old Stephanie Bryan in 1955 shattered many Berkeley residents’ notion that they lived in a safe community.

He and his father would never fictionalize that story. But there are elements, small details, of the case that intrigue him. Like how Berkeley police ended up catching the killer. The murderer, Burton Abbot, a 27-year-old accounting student at UC Berkeley, had kept a souvenir of Byron’s — her red purse with an ID card inside His wife found it and alerted the cops.

“Just an idea. That one small thing, a wife discovering something she can’t explain in her basement, her husband’s attempt to provide an innocuous explanation for how this came to be in their house… you can build out a story from this germ.”

As for Half Moon Bay, Kellerman is a regular reader of Berkeleyside and took note when UC Berkeley announced it would build a 1,200 student housing structure at People’s Park, as well as supportive housing for about 150 formerly homeless people. He knew immediately that it would make a good plot point.

The Kellermans’ protagonist, Clay Edison, investigates cold cases. So the authors created one. When bulldozers tear apart the Free Speech Stage to prep the site for housing, the body of an infant is found. Clay Edison, a deputy sheriff assigned to the coroner’s office, investigates.

The duo’s next novel, The Burning, is coming out later this year. One of its plot points? The massive wildfires that have consumed California in recent years.

Frances Dinkelspiel is co-founder and executive editor of Berkeleyside.","“Everything we are seeing now is described in the first pages of the book,” said Jesse Kellerman, who lives in Berkeley (his father lives in Los Angeles).

2020 was a record-breaking year for the U.S. housing market, and Alabama was no exception. Investment in the state generated a lot of attention from publications around the globe as a variety of Alabama destinations appear at the top of the list for booming markets.

Here are a few examples of Alabama destinations identified by industry leaders as ones to watch:

Lake Guntersville

As the pandemic has shifted interest to more rural, scenic driven destinations, places like Marshall County, Alabama, have surfaced to the top of real estate searches. According to Market Watch, Marshall County led the country in the percentage of increased searches for micropolitan communities. The area surrounding Lake Guntersville saw an increase of 2817% on the Redfin.com website in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the same quarter in 2019.

Montgomery

Appearing in two notable publications, Alabama’s capital city has been recognized for its affordability, promising job market and appeal to travelers. Forbes Advisor looked at 100 metro areas with a population of at least 100,000 to identify the top 10 most affordable cities for homebuyers. Appearing at No. 8, Montgomery offers the lowest median annual real estate taxes and is poised for growth based on continued investment from the aerospace and automotive employers. In addition, the continued expansion of Montgomery’s social justice attractions has drawn attention from Bloomberg who has listed it as one of the best places to travel in 2021.

Tuscaloosa

Leading the national trend in real estate is the continued growth of vacation rental property investments. According to the real estate education publication Fortune Builders, Tuscaloosa is No. 2 in the country on the list of places to buy a vacation rental property. Citing the year-over-year growth in tourism both inside and outside of football season, this Alabama city bodes well for investors looking for potential profits in rental investments.

Gulf Shores / Orange Beach



No stranger to second home real estate investors, the beautiful beaches of Alabama’s gulf coast have been an attractive destination for years. In spite of the changes 2020 brought to the investment landscape, this area proves to be dependable for travel-hungry tourists. Air DNA tracks the performance data of over 10 million AirB&B and VRBO vacation rentals and published a list of the best places to buy short-term rental property in the U.S. When it comes to areas with over 1,000 active short-term rentals, Gulf Shores / Orange Beach scored number eight for its annual revenue potential and annual revenue growth.

Dauphin Island

As reported by CNBC, the vacation rental management website Vacasa has rolled out its annual report highlighting the best U.S. destinations to invest in a vacation rental property. The study analyzed home sales and rental data in vacation areas around the country. For the second year in a row, the “sunset capital of Alabama” has made the list.

Birmingham

The Magic City appeared on several real estate investment lists in 2020. In its analysis of America’s hottest real estate zip codes, Forbes lists Birmingham first on the list. The analysis uses data from Zillow.com to determine America’s fastest-growing zip codes by home sale price appreciation. Property Wire lists Birmingham as one of five on its 2020 best areas to invest and the international publication Global Investments lists it as the next U.S. property investment hotspot. Additionally, Travel and Leisure magazine includes Birmingham as of the best places to travel in 2021.

Huntsville

Alabama’s Rocket City made the list of emerging real estate markets of 2020 according to Mashvisor, an analytics service company focused on providing investors with property information. Huntsville is noted as one of the markets leading the economic recovery in the nation.

Auburn



Housing Wire, a digital publication focussed on mortgage and housing markets placed Auburn on the 2020 best locations for investment property. The only Alabama city to make the rankings, Auburn was listed in second place for the highest population growth and first place for employment growth.

5 days ago,This Is Anfield,Full-backs steal the headlines in busy weekend for Liverpool loanees,"Liverpool’s first team finally got back to winning ways over the weekend, while plenty of out-on-loan players were handed further experience and game time too.

It wasn’t a weekend to follow the usual recent pattern, with goals galore scored or assisted by the talented youngsters who have departed on a temporary basis.

Indeed, not one of the on-loan Reds managed to net or create a goal this weekend – or keep a clean sheet, for the goalkeepers.

Instead, the most impressive showings came from a couple of full-backs who have had to overcome adversity and difficult challenges over the last year or two, and while a run-of-the-mill Saturday league game might not seem particularly exciting in the wider context of the game, becoming a regular and established player is exactly what these loan spells are for.

To that end, Sepp van den Berg‘s recent outings are a huge step forward.

With Preston this weekend he was once again deployed at right-back and once again gave a good account of himself – as a supporting, safe-playing ball-winner rather than a rampaging attacking outlet, of course.

His team won 3-0 to move into 13th, with the Dutchman completing back-to-back 90s in the space of three days, tallying five tackles, four interceptions and five clearances across those two matches for a notable progressive step.

One league further down, Adam Lewis was restored to the line-up with Plymouth, playing the vast majority of the game at left-wing back in a crazy 4-3 win.

This was his first League One start since mid-January and comes on the back of several recent run-outs off the bench. It remains to be seen if it was rotation or a case of winning back his place, but Lewis certainly had an impact in both halves with a shot, a couple of chances created and, defensively, two tackles won and a shot blocked.

The theme of returning to the line-up after difficult spells also applies to Loris Karius, who kept goal for Union Berlin for a third successive game.

His four Bundesliga appearances this season haven’t yet yielded a victory, but he was kept busy enough by Hoffenheim in a 1-1 draw, the away side having three shots on target.

It wasn’t a weekend for the attackers to impact on this occasion, with Harry Wilson starting and Sheyi Ojo coming on as sub as Cardiff drew, Harvey Elliott drawing a blank in Blackburn’s 1-1 with Coventry and Liam Millar being subbed at the break as Charlton made a poor start in an eventual 3-0 defeat to former Under-23 coach Neil Critchley and his Blackpool side.

Overseas, Kamil Grabara conceded three in a draw at the top end of the table, Marko Grujic was left to watch on from the bench as Porto were held by leaders Sporting CP and Colombian defender Anderson Arroyo featured in a friendly.

5 days ago,Streetsblog New York,Monday’s Headlines: Andrew Cuomo is Finished (Or is He?) Edition,"Monday’s Headlines: Andrew Cuomo is Finished (Or is He?) Edition

Most of us (except the Daily News, see Sunday front page, right) spent the weekend Schadenfreuding all over Andrew Cuomo, whose long reign at the top of New York’s political oligarchy effectively ended when he faced reality and realized he could not have a political crony “investigate” the charges that he sexually harassed two young staffers.

At least, that’s Ross Barkan’s take — and he’s had a string of on-point takes recently. Plus, he has a book coming out about Cuomo’s handling of the COVID-19 crisis that includes the governor’s initial February scandal over nursing home deaths. (Stop the presses — this book needs an epilogue!).

Mayor de Blasio also relished the impending fall of his longtime nemesis (NY Post, amNY). And the Post was exceptionally excited, publishing roughly 423 stories between Saturday, when the Times broke the “second accuser” story, and Sunday night. The Paper of Record was no slough, either, publishing several follow-ups, including one about the Smug Guv’s attempt at an apology.

In other news:

The Daily News did a big takeout on the city’s Open Culture program, which will start accepting applications today, but, um, even a long story in a credible paper can’t really explain how this is all going to work. Can someone help our struggling artists, please?

In a related story, what we really need is a WPA-type program for artists. (Gothamist)

We hate to say we told you so, but we told you that the overnight shutdown would lead people to say, “Why do we need 24-7 service anyway?” (Bloomberg)

Remember our award-nominated series on the NYPD’s racially biased “jaywalking” summonses? Well, The New Yorker had a great story about a man who is about to be deported by ICE because he was charged with crossing against a light in The Bronx.

Are we still doing this? OK, so some business owners in Astoria have started a petition to block a new protected bike lane on 31st Street because, get this, the plan “would make the streets more dangerous for cyclists — since many businesses on the busy corridor make deliveries [and] park equipment by the street,” the LIC Post reported.

So in other words, driver want to do unsafe things, so we probably shouldn’t try to make the roadway safer. The petition drive has the support of the Queens Chamber, which spent much of Sunday trolling cyclists on Twitter (and getting trolled right back by everyone). The Chamber responded (right) by blocking many Queens residents on Twitter (which prompted more trolling!).

You have to love the coverage of Friday afternoon’s 11-car pileup on the Prospect Expressway, with the Post concluding, “It was also not know whaat [sic] caused the crash.” It wasn’t? Eleven cars? The second-most notorious speedway* in the city? Do. The. Math. Someone was speeding.

And, finally, it’s a little north of our old man editor’s favorite part of Germany, but we all need to retire in Heidelberg, apparently. (NY Times)

1 week ago,ABC News,GOP congressman headlines conference where organizers push white nationalist rhetoric,"The group's leader said of Jan. 6, ""We need a little bit more of that energy.""

GOP Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona was the surprise keynote speaker at a conference Friday night in Orlando, Florida, where speakers spread white nationalist rhetoric, organizers railed about the U.S. losing its ""white demographic core,"" and some called for further engagement like the ire that drove the Capitol attack on Jan. 6.

Gosar, who skipped Friday's House votes -- including the vote on the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package -- spoke Friday night at the America First Political Action Conference (AFPAC), where he blamed former President Donald Trump's election loss on ""big business, big tech, and the swamp,"" and pushed anti-immigration arguments to the crowd of ""Groypers,"" a loose coalition of mostly young alt-right extremists led by organizer Nick Fuentes.

In the days leading up to the event and while marketing tickets online in part by using his Twitter account, Fuentes teased that there would be a special guest, which turned out to be Gosar. Other speakers Friday night included former Iowa Representative Steve King, who's known for his long history of racist comments, and conservative commentator Michelle Malkin.

After speaking at the event, less than 12 hours later Gosar was featured on a panel Saturday morning at the ongoing Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) happening concurrently to AFPAC in the Orlando area. Speaking on a panel moderated by CPAC's own Mercedes Schlapp, Gosar criticized the Biden administration's immigration policies.

At the start of the panel, Gosar -- unprompted and without mentioning Friday's event or Fuentes by name -- attempted to distance himself from ""racism.""

""I want to tell you, I denounce when we talk about white racism. That's not appropriate. I believe in a strong immigration system,"" Gosar said.

Neither Gosar nor representatives for CPAC responded to ABC News' requests for comment on the congressman's speech at the AFPAC event.

On Friday night, Gosar's keynote was followed by a speech by Fuentes that was filled with white grievance and far-right anti-immigration rhetoric. ""If [America] loses its white demographic core … then this is not America anymore,"" the AFPAC founder told the crowd.

Fuentes went on to praise the Capitol attack, boasting about it leading to a delay in the certification of the election results.

""While I was there in D.C., outside of the building, and I saw hundreds of thousands of patriots surrounding the U.S. Capitol building and I saw the police retreating ... I said to myself: 'This is awesome,'"" Fuentes said to the applause of the crowd.

And amid security concerns over threats to disrupt President Joe Biden's expected speech to a joint session of Congress, Fuentes encouraged more of the kind of commitment shown by rioters on Jan. 6.

""To see that Capitol under siege, to see the people of this country rise up and mobilize to D.C. with the pitchforks and the torches -- we need a little bit more of that energy in the future,"" he said.

Gosar, who was elected to Congress in 2011, has emerged as one of the most far-right Republicans in Washington. In January, The New York Times first reported that a leading member of an Oath Keepers chapter in Arizona, Jim Arroyo, posted a video on YouTube claiming Gosar attended one of their meetings and supported the group's calls for a war in the country.

""We did a meeting a couple of years ago where our elected representative from Washington, Paul Gosar, came out and we asked him flat out at that time, 'Do you think we're heading into a civil war?'"" Arroyo said. ""And his response was just flat out, 'We're in it. We just haven't started shooting at each other yet.'"" Gosar did not respond to the Times' request for comment.

During the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, Gosar posted a message on Twitter calling for protesters not to ""get carried away."" But over on the right-leaning Parler service, he shared a far more sympathetic message, using the same photo of people scaling the walls of the Capitol and writing, ""Americans are upset.""

Gosar's featured appearance at Friday's event will be another major test for a Republican Party that is being pulled between traditional conservatives and a growing radical extremist element as it searches for a path forward following the pro-Trump Capitol attack.

Earlier this month, the House approved a resolution that removed newly elected Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from her assigned committees due to a long history of pushing QAnon rhetoric and baseless conspiracy theories, including that the Sandy Hook and Parkland shootings were staged ""false flag"" operations. Green apologized to House members for her previous comments prior to the vote.

And former President Trump issued the first blow of his revenge tour on Republicans who voted to impeach him, endorsing Max Miller, a former Trump aide, in his primary challenge against Rep. Anthony Gonzalez (R-Ohio), who was among 10 House Republicans to vote for impeachment.

Trump's name was a recurring theme at Friday night's event, with Fuentes also promising to target Republicans who were not sufficiently loyal to the former president.

""He is one of us,"" Fuentes told the crowd.

Friday night's AFPAC event marked one of the first major gatherings of far-right extremists since the Jan. 6 insurrection. The event featured at least two people, Fuentes and AFPAC speaker Vincent James Foxx, who were present near the Capitol building during the siege.

Fuentes, who has denied involvement in the storming of the Capitol itself, has been spotted in videos and photos rallying outside the Capitol on Jan. 6. In one video, Fuentes can be seen on a megaphone telling the crowd not to ""leave this Capitol until Donald Trump is inaugurated president."" Foxx, who on Friday night said, ""We must not be afraid of the idea of secession,"" was photographed with Fuentes on Jan. 6. Neither man was charged in connection with the riot.

Fuentes, who attended the 2017 ""Unite the Right"" rally at Charlottesville, has a long history of making racist and anti-Semitic comments. Since the Capitol insurrection, a handful of America First followers have been arrested for their participation in the Jan. 6 attack.

After spending parts of his speech Friday night celebrating the Capitol riot, Fuentes at one point attempted to walk back his comments.

""I disavow all violence. I disavow all vandalism. I respect the government is sovereign over us,"" he said -- then added, ""Alright, I think that'll stand up in court.""","Neither Gosar nor representatives for CPAC responded to ABC News' requests for comment on the congressman's speech at the AFPAC event.
On Friday night, Gosar's keynote was followed by a speech by Fuentes that was filled with white grievance and far-right anti-immigration rhetoric.

1 week ago,CBSSports.com,"Ranking veteran QB options for Patriots: Jimmy Garoppolo headlines group, don't rule out a Cam Newton return","The Patriots are a team without a quarterback at the moment, which is essentially the last place you want to be in the NFL. For the second offseason in a row, they are looking to replace Tom Brady, who seems to be enjoying himself quite a bit as he celebrates his Super Bowl LV title after inking a deal with the Buccaneers last March. For his old club in New England, it's back to the drawing board after a 2020 season that saw them under .500 for the first time since 2000 and on the outside looking in for the postseason.

What Bill Belichick has working in his favor this offseason is that his club is now armed with a ton of cap space and owns a number of draft picks -- including No. 15 overall -- that he can utilize to improve the collective talent of his club. However, finding the quarterback needs to be priority No. 1. We're going to highlight and rank a number of realistic options the Patriots could target to be their next quarterback heading into 2021.

This list will be reserved for signal-callers already in the league, leaving out the potential for New England to draft someone at No. 15. However, outside of possibly the top-two options on this list, adding a young prospect like Mac Jones, Justin Fields, Trey Lance or whoever falls to them in the first round would be an ideal complement to the veteran signee and give New England's QB room much higher upside going forward.

There was an error processing your subscription.

Before we get to the list, let's quickly mention a few quarterbacks who are not on here. That would include some of the higher-profile players who are reportedly on the block like Russell Wilson and Deshaun Watson. Not only have these quarterbacks not identified New England as a place they'd want to land, but the Patriots don't have enough assets to outbid other QB-needy teams (Jets, Panthers, Dolphins, etc.) for their services. The other QB who isn't on here is Sam Darnold because New York would absolutely not trade him within the division.

Veteran QB options

Jimmy Garoppolo SF • QB • 10 CMP% 67.1 YDs 1096 TD 7 INT 5 YD/Att 7.83 View Profile

Pretty obvious, right? Jimmy Garoppolo has been the most popular name talked about when discussing potential quarterbacks the Patriots could acquire this offseason. Belichick essentially drafted him for this post-Brady period and it seems only fitting that things come full circle and he fulfills his destiny in Foxborough. Despite publicly stating that they are sticking by Garoppolo heading into 2021, there is a ton of smoke around the 49ers, who are seemingly testing the waters in hopes of finding an upgrade. New England may have to wait until the draft to see if Garoppolo becomes available, but if the Niners swing a deal for Sam Darnold and pick a QB in the draft, it wouldn't be surprising to hear that Belichick was quick to call San Francisco about his former second-round pick.

Marcus Mariota LV • QB • 8 CMP% 60.7 YDs 226 TD 1 INT 1 YD/Att 8.07 View Profile

Mariota opened a lot of eyes with his performance back in Week 15 when he came in under duress for an injured Derek Carr. The former No. 2 overall pick came out of the gate with some nice passes, completed around 60% of his throws for 226 yards, and kept the Raiders in contention, despite falling to the Chargers. He also rushed for 88 yards and a touchdown in that contest. That game now has teams intrigued about possibly acquiring Mariota to see if he can provide that play on a weekly basis. While it doesn't appear like clubs want to take on his current contract, Mariota could be released by the Raiders, who are looking to get some cap relief. If that's the case, he's a strong target for the Patriots.

He's still relatively young at 27 years old, has 61 starts under his belt dating back to his days in Tennessee, and has largely kept turnovers to a minimum. After finding success with Cam Newton's rushing ability in 2020, New England could also utilize Mariota's mobility in its offense as well.

Jacoby Brissett IND • QB • 7 CMP% 25.0 YDs 17 TD 0 INT 0 YD/Att 2.13 View Profile

Another member of the infamous Wolf Pack that the Patriots had under their roof not too long ago. Similar to Garoppolo, Brissett brings a familiarity of the Patriots offense with him that would make a transition a bit more seamless if New England were to re-acquire him in free agency. While the ceiling may not be tremendously high for the former third-rounder, if the right situation is built around him, he should be able to win games for Belichick. That said, Brissett did come out of the gate strong back in 2019 as a member of the Colts. Through the first six games, he completed 65% of his throws, averaged 231.3 passing yards per game, and had 14 touchdowns to just three interceptions. If the Patriots could get that from Brissett on a consistent basis, that'd be a massive addition.

Ryan Fitzpatrick MIA • QB • 14 CMP% 68.5 YDs 2091 TD 13 INT 8 YD/Att 7.83 View Profile

He's played for every other team in the AFC East, so why not take the full tour? Fitzpatrick would be an ideal addition for the Patriots in the event that they also draft a quarterback at No. 15. Similar to how the veteran operated last season in Miami, he could begin the year as the starter and allow whichever rookie quarterback that comes in the necessary time to get acclimated to the NFL. As we've seen over the last few years, FitzMagic still has plenty of fuel in his arm and would give New England an aerial attack that they were lacking in 2020.

5. Cam Newton

Cam Newton NE • QB • 1 CMP% 65.8 YDs 2657 TD 8 INT 10 YD/Att 7.22 View Profile

While most fans have automatically ruled out a Cam Newton return in 2021, I'm not so bullish on that assumption. As I've noted in the past, there does seem to be a solid chance that Newton finds his way back to New England next season. Despite his struggles, Bill Belichick was extremely loyal to Newton throughout last year and it wouldn't be too surprising to see him remain loyal as he hits free agency, especially if the Patriots aren't able to land a top-tier option. There would also be motivation on Newton's end as New England likely gives him the best opportunity to start next year.

Tyrod Taylor LAC • QB • 5 CMP% 53.3 YDs 208 TD 0 INT 0 YD/Att 6.93 View Profile

Tyrod Taylor has largely been a bridesmaid and never the bride throughout his pro career. After finding his footing as a starter in Buffalo, the Bills eventually let him go for Josh Allen. That trend continued during his next few stops in Cleveland (replaced for Baker Mayfield) and Los Angeles (replaced for Justin Herbert). When given the starting job, however, Taylor has been serviceable. Over the course of his three years as the Bills starter from 2015-2017, Taylor was efficient and kept his turnovers extremely low, which is an attractive trait to New England. The 31-year-old isn't a long-term option for the Patriots but could be a good stop-gap that gives them a nice blend of mobility and efficiency in the passing game, something they searched for desperately last year with Newton.

Andy Dalton DAL • QB • 14 CMP% 64.9 YDs 2170 TD 14 INT 8 YD/Att 6.52 View Profile

At one point last offseason, it felt like Dalton was destined to be the veteran that inks a deal with the Patriots, but he opted to be Dak Prescott's backup for his hometown Cowboys. After Prescott suffered that gruesome ankle injury, Dalton was able to start nine games for Dallas and went 4-5 over those games. From New England's point of view, the 33-year-old is another veteran that is likely best as a combination paired with a high draft pick. He's more traditional than some of the quarterbacks above him on this list and the playbook would probably be more similar to 2019 than 2020 if they were to bring him aboard.

Teddy Bridgewater CAR • QB • 5 CMP% 69.1 YDs 3733 TD 15 INT 11 YD/Att 7.59 View Profile

If Bridgewater were a free agent, he'd probably be higher on this list. However, he's under contract with the Panthers and would only become available if Carolina pulls off a blockbuster trade that lands them a superstar QB. Because there is a more difficult path to Foxborough, it's knocked Bridgewater down a few pegs. While the Panthers went 4-11 with Bridgewater as the starter in 2020, the 28-year-old was pretty efficient. He completed nearly 70% of his passes and had a passer rating of 92.1 last season. That skill set is something Belichick values tremendously and Bridgewater has shown through his undefeated run with the Saints in 2019 that he can lead a capable roster to victories. Again, it really just comes down to whether or not he becomes available.

Gardner Minshew JAC • QB • 15 CMP% 66.1 YDs 2259 TD 16 INT 5 YD/Att 6.91 View Profile

The Jaguars are about to usher in the Trevor Lawrence era, leaving Gardner Minshew no room to reclaim the starting job in Jacksonville. This could be an opportunity for the Patriots to acquire Minshew, who is extremely low-cost, and see if he can evolve into an even better starter than he was over the course of his rookie and sophomore seasons. Throughout his first two campaigns, Minshew has kept his interceptions relatively low and has been pretty accurate, completing 62.9% of his throws thus far. This could be a low-risk, high-reward option that won't cost New England much to acquire.

Nick Foles CHI • QB • 9 CMP% 64.7 YDs 1852 TD 10 INT 8 YD/Att 5.94 View Profile

It would be a bit odd to have the quarterback who snatched a Super Bowl LII title away from them now putting on their uniform as the starter, but after all the curveballs that the past year-plus has given us, we probably wouldn't even bat an eye. Similar to Bridgewater, Foles is still under contract and the Bears and would likely need Chicago to upgrade the QB position before they consider moving him. They also need to be willing to swallow a dead cap hit of around $10 million. If Chicago solidifies its quarterback situation, however, Foles is a pretty cheap option for New England the next two seasons. While he likely isn't going to reach that Super Bowl-winning ceiling again, he could be another steady veteran option that takes coaching well.","We're going to highlight and rank a number of realistic options the Patriots could target to be their next quarterback heading into 2021.

1 week ago,Yahoo News,Former President Trump headlines conservative gathering CPAC,"Conservative Political Action Conference 2021 attendees are in Orlando, Florida as the annual conference gets underway. Former President Donald Trump is set to make his first post-presidency speech Sunday at the event. Politico Playbook co-author, Tara Palmeri, joins CBSN with a preview of what's to come at CPAC.

Video Transcript

ANNE-MARIE GREEN: So the annual Conservative Political Action Conference is officially underway in Orlando, Florida. Organized and sponsored by the American Conservative Union, the Conference-- the Conference, rather-- is the largest gathering of conservative activists in the United States. And this year, the focus is on former President Trump, who is scheduled to make his first public speech since leaving the White House.

So joining us now from Orlando to talk more about what we can expect from the event this year is ""Politico Playbook"" co-author Tara Palmeri. Thank you so much for joining us, Tara. So I guess, first off, just give us a snapshot of what things are like on the ground there at CPAC. What are the big names that will be attending? What are the issues that they will be discussing? What's on the agenda?

TARA PALMERI: Well, despite the fact that we're in the middle of a pandemic and basically no major company would be holding a conference at this point, it's amazing that there is such a big turnout. People are showing up in droves, the grassroots of the conservative party. And it seems like the one person on their mind, on their lips, is President Trump.

And, you know, this is an opportunity for 2024 hopefuls to come and make their pitch to grassroots and do their stump speech. You've got Senator Tom Cotton coming up this afternoon. You've got Senator Josh Hawley, Donald Trump, Jr. coming up this afternoon. They are all considered-- widely considered to be potential 2024 nominees.

But it's almost like all the air has been sucked out of the room by the grand finale on Sunday, which is President Trump. And there's this-- this picture that's made the rounds on social media of a gold-plated Trump statue in some sort of, like, boxer shorts, red, white, and blue boxer shorts. And it's just sort of, like, a symbol of everything here, a gilded statue of, really, the leader of the conservative movement right now.

Story continues

And I think all eyes for us political types and reporters to see, like, how far do these 2024 potentials go in terms of embracing President Trump? How much do they push on voter fraud and the fact that the election was stolen-- that is, in their minds? And the bigger issue behind the voter fraud-- the voter fraud allegations is how it depresses voting and how that will affect future elections.

So I don't think that the Republican Party has completely squared that line away. With claiming that your votes don't count, how does that drive people to the polls?

VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: It's really interesting, Tara. And one of the things that I find kind of remarkable given that former President Trump is going to be speaking at CPAC is what we just heard yesterday from Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Remember what Mitch McConnell said about the events of the insurrection when talking about President Trump's role in it.

He essentially said that the President of the United States was responsible for the events that led up to the January 6 insurrection. He then yesterday, all of a sudden, says he would also support President Trump should he win the party's nomination. He absolutely would support, is in fact the quote. ""Absolutely"" is the quote.

And, you know, just a couple of weeks ago, he voted to acquit the president, but he criticized what he called a disgraceful dereliction of duty. So that are-- those are the words that Mitch McConnell used to describe the former president-- disgraceful dereliction of duty. But now he's saying he'd support him again in 2024. So what are you seeing there within the Republican Party?

On one hand, it seems performative to say to the American people in the wake of that attack, you know, here's what Donald Trump did and why he's responsible, and we should never let this happen ever again. Oh, by the way, let's nominate him again for president of the United States.

TARA PALMERI: It's a really interesting point. You know, they're trying to have it both ways-- Mitch McConnell, Nikki Haley, and others-- Kevin McCarthy. I think it's also interesting that Mitch McConnell was disinvited from CPAC this year. He's-- my sources tell me he is going to be the boogieman of CPAC.

You know, he is a symbol of the establishment. And this conference every year is really about the grassroots, right? And we know-- and I know from my sources that President Trump plans to take aim at Mitch McConnell and point out all of the seats that he claimed that the party won in both the House and the Senate because of his leadership, not because of McConnell's, right?

It's really dividing a line between the two Republican parties. It's just another battle in the GOP Civil War. And, you know, like you said, this is President Trump's first speech since January 6, since leaving office. And I think all eyes are just on the level of fury, how he positions himself.

My sources tell me that privately he keeps saying he's going to run in 2024. They're all skeptical, right? But the truth is that all the polling shows that he is the most popular Republican in the Republican Party by a long shot. The only person who comes even close to him, according to our Morning Consult polls, is Vice President Pence, and he's polling around 12%. Trump's over 50% in terms of popularity with Republicans in terms of being chosen as the potential candidate for the nomination, the nominee for the Republican Party.

So it's just like-- it's interesting. You'll see-- and I'm going to be looking really closely at Tom Cottin. I'm going to be looking really closely at Josh Hawley. You know, how much do they praise Trump? How much do they align themselves with him as the leader of the party? How much do they see his-- you know, his support as the ticket, as the key to being the Republican nominee? I think that's something we're all looking out for right now at CPAC. But right now, it just feels like Trump PAC.

ANNE-MARIE GREEN: Hmm. And so that leads me sort of to my next question about the evolution of this gathering, what you've noticed. You know, there are going to be conversations about voter fraud. And I think, like, talking about voter fraud is a way to talk about, you know, a stolen election without saying a stolen election, right?

Let's talk about voter fraud, because who can't get behind that? When we know there's no widespread voter fraud. We've known that forever. It's been proven over and over again. There are one-off situations, but nothing that would flip an election in any way, shape, or form. And, you know, as I'm looking at how--

TARA PALMERI: Not in the millions of votes-- yeah.

ANNE-MARIE GREEN: Exactly.

TARA PALMERI: Not in the millions of votes that they've claimed, right.

ANNE-MARIE GREEN: And as I'm sort of-- right. And as you're watching sort of on Capitol Hill, as more moderate, if you want, Republicans are vilified, censured back in their home states, are-- what we're seeing at CPAC, has it morphed from kind of a conversation about conservative values into kind of a focus on the most kind of extreme, I guess, ends of the spectrum when it comes to conservative thought? Or beyond that, beyond conservative thought into-- I don't know-- conspiracy theories.

TARA PALMERI: So I think CPAC has always been a reflection of the party, right, the grassroots of the party. And the grassroots of the party is becoming more extreme. This is the Republican Party right now. President Trump still won 74 million votes. That's a lot of votes, more Republican-- more votes than any Republican in the past decade.

So, you know, what you hear at CPAC over the next few days, those-- those ideas, those thoughts that kind of percolate in the fringes, sometimes they tend to become, you know, the actual talking points later on, the standard bearers, the issues in the conservative party. I think, you know, you can't ignore the grassroots.

I went out to Wyoming after Liz Cheney voted, you know, to impeach President Trump. And I really struggled to find anyone to support her. That is a Trump state. I think he got 80 points in that state in the 2020 election.

And it was Trump before Cheney. You know, Cheney represented the establishment to them, and they felt that her vote didn't reflect them. And the grassroots loves Trump. And I think that the-- that these-- these Republicans are in a tough spot. Unless they're in very moderate, suburban swing districts, you know, they've got to-- they sort of feel like they have to toe the line. And, you know, the line is Trump now.

VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Yeah. It's very clear that that's the case. So you mentioned that the-- the party is Trump. And he's headlining this conference. Any idea what we can expect to hear? You know, the-- the-- I don't know if it's a risk, Tara, but, you know, what I think we can all surmise is if you just take a look at the letter that President Trump-- the statement that President Trump released after he was acquitted in his impeachment trial, you know, he attacked Mitch McConnell, And? He claimed, once again, that he won the election.

So I suspect that what we'll hear from the former president are a list of grievances of the people that have wronged him, a lot of whining about why, you know, Democrats and the lamestream media attacked him relentlessly for four years. And, again, sort of the notion that he won the election. And you'll probably hear people cheering that notion, which is absolutely false.

TARA PALMERI: Right. I mean, Trump is sort of like the martyr of the party, right? Like that's his position right now. He sees, you know, Mar-a-Lago, Palm Beach, Florida as the center of his Republican Party. And he will be trying to distance himself from Washington in his speech as much as possible. That's what aides have told me.

He will blast Mitch McConnell. He'll blast the establishment. He'll try to say that they're not in touch with the party. He'll try to-- sorry about that. I think I may have lost you. But he'll try to point out that there are a lot of seats-- he'll claim that there are seats in both the Senate and the House that were won because of him, not because of Mitch McConnell.

He'll try to solidify himself as the leader of the party outside of Washington and make the point that the Republican Party is the grassroots. It's not the elected officials. So, you know, Trump is going to play the outlier card, which he used in 2016, all over again. It's hard to play that card when you're the president, right?

You know, you've got to work with the Senate. You've got to work with the Congress. You are in Washington, but he's not anymore. So he can sort of play it-- play it loose and go after the people that he would have had to work with. And, you know, there are some people on the other side the GOP war that are willing to really fight against him, like Liz Cheney. But it's-- and Mitt Romney, was also disinvited from CPAC.

But it's hard to find others that will stand-- that will really stand up to him definitively. Like Mitch McConnell won't. Nikki Haley-- I reported in ""Politico"" last week that after, you know, condemning Trump very forcefully for January 6, that she asked to meet with him at Mar-a-Lago. And he said no.

And that, you know, is going to be the story we keep seeing from Republicans who kind of chose their conscience, right? Nikki Haley also wants to run for president in 2024. That's a pretty open secret in Washington. But can she do it without Trump? I mean, I mentioned to someone-- an organizer here at CPAC, you know, why isn't Nikki Haley here? And they were like, she probably would have been booed. Trump's--

ANNE-MARIE GREEN: Wow.

TARA PALMERI: Trump's supporters, which is a huge part of the Republican Party, you know, they remember those things.

VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Are they-- so, Tara-- the question--

TARA PALMERI: That's why his endorsement goes so far.

VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Yeah, so then the question really becomes, Tara, why play games? Why not just have people admit that it's not about policies? It's not about conservative values. You know, there may be some policies that they appreciate that President Trump sort of supported and maybe in some cases implemented, but really it's the cult of personality. They like the man. They think that he can do no wrong, and whatever he does, they're supportive of it. It doesn't matter if it ranges from alleged crimes to, you know, the allegations around the insurrection.

As opposed to making it about conservative values, as opposed to making it about conservative policies, like the deficit, or a strong military, or America's--

TARA PALMERI: Well, that-- it's really hard for them to--

VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Right.

TARA PALMERI: It's almost impossible for them to stand by those same policies that they've always stood by. The deficit-- you know, President Trump supported. And, you know, congressional Republicans and Senate Republicans supported trillions of dollars in stimulus during COVID. Tax-- the tax cuts bill, that also added to the deficit. The deficit's not a talking point they really want to be talking about much anymore, right? I mean, you don't hear much-- you don't hear many talks about that.

Anti-military-- I mean, Trump-- yeah, he-- he kind of went both ways, sort of with, like, a tinge of ire at the military establishment, but also supporting them because he realized it's his voters. He wanted to pull out of the wars in the Middle East. You know, it's just-- like, it's really-- he's changed-- he's changed the party. You know, he appeals to evangelicals, but he's not an evangelical himself.

VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Right.

TARA PALMERI: It's sort of like he can give them enough. The party has changed with Trump. You're not going to hear the same talking points anymore. But here's the real problem. People like Mitch McConnell, people like Kevin McCarthy, it's on them to make sure that they're raising money, a lot of it from corporates that don't like the things that are coming out of Trump's mouth, right?

And that money is the money that's used by their members to buy ads in local markets, to run campaigns. And they don't like what Trump is saying. So how do you raise money with Trump, right? Although Trump also said he raises money from the grassroots, which is true. He has an insane donor list. And it's up to him if he wants to use that to help members in the House and Senate. Again, they're going to have to take a loyalty-- the loyalty oath to him.

There's also the issue of winning over moderate voters. A lot of suburban women who did not vote for Trump, who had abandoned a lot of Republicans because of their loyalty to him, you can't win generals, really, without them. Now, they go both ways. We know that. They're swing voters. But, you know, Trump isn't someone that they have this strong affinity for the way that the grassroots does.

So while Trump may-- you know, may help you win a primary, it might not help you in the general against an actual Democrat. So the leaders are thinking more the long game, right? I do wonder more instances like Georgia happen over and over again, how can the Republican Party survive, if it just keeps losing seats because, you know, the candidates can't actually win in a primary?

I mean, I really do think this whole idea of voter fraud and the election being stolen did not drive out votes in Georgia. How are you supposed to get people to the polls if they don't think that their vote counts? Who's going to wait for hours to cast a ballot? And actually, early voting is what helped Trump win Florida. And that was one of the things that he said contributed to voter fraud, mail-in ballots, all of that.

So it's like-- it's just-- it's a catchy-- it's a catchy line. It's a way to explain the loss. But people aren't thinking about the long-term repercussions, what these-- what these talking points mean and how they actually resonate with voters and actually how they're going to influence the behavior of the people they need to go out and vote.

VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: That's an excellent point. You often hear from Trump supporters--

ANNE-MARIE GREEN: Mm-hm.

VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: --you know, the ones that I've spoken to, the ones that I know in my own personal life, you know, well, he's not perfect. He doesn't say things perfectly, and that's what we like about him. But that standard is not applied to anybody else. If one person who they don't like or they disagree with politically says something-- you know, a slip of the tongue or whatever it is, it's game over.

So-- so this cult of personality is, I think, kind of interesting. And when you factor in to the game of play that you've had, as you pointed out, Tara, folks like Nikki Haley or Mitch McConnell coming out very forcefully and criticizing the president of the United States when the time is politically right for them to do so, but seeming-- seeing that they're not invited to CPAC, for example, all these statements of support for former President Trump, it's sort of very telling.

Tara, always great to have you. It's been a while. Thanks for joining us.

TARA PALMERI: Yeah, thanks for having me. It's great to talk to you guys.","And this year, the focus is on former President Trump, who is scheduled to make his first public speech since leaving the White House.
And it seems like the one person on their mind, on their lips, is President Trump.
But it's almost like all the air has been sucked out of the room by the grand finale on Sunday, which is President Trump.
He then yesterday, all of a sudden, says he would also support President Trump should he win the party's nomination.
The deficit-- you know, President Trump supported."

1 week ago,KELOLAND.com,Gov. Noem headlines national conservative stage; says Florida trip not taxpayer funded,"SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (KELO) — When former President Donald Trump gives his first speech since leaving office this weekend, Governor Kristi Noem will be there.

Noem is also set to speak at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, in Florida.

Governor Noem has top billing at the CPAC Convention in Orlando. She will speak on Saturday at 2:50 p.m. CST.

The CPAC Convention is host to many anti-maskers, including the former president himself. However, both Orange County Florida and the CPAC convention say they will enforce mask mandates for everyone. On Friday, the audience was told to wear masks.

Carly Conley / CPAC and Events Director: When you’re seated, you should still be wearing a mask. So if everybody can go ahead, work on that. I know, I know, it’s not the most fun.

Audience: Boos and shouts, “Freedom!

Dan Schneider / CPAC Executive Director: You have the right to set the own rules in your own house. And we’re borrowing somebody else’s House, so we need to comply with their rules.



In terms of what Noem has to say to the audience, she didn’t get into specifics at her news conference this week, but did say she would talk about her home state.

“Well, I’ll tell a little bit of South Dakota’s story. That’s what’s important to me; that people understand how special the state is and the people that live here and also about what this legislature is doing right now: making responsible decisions, not just for the people here and protecting their health, but also growing the economy and protecting it for future generations.” Gov. Kristi Noem, on what she will talk about at CPAC.

Subjects of various talks at the CPAC include “The Left’s Assault on a Free People: How Government, Big Tech, and Media Are Colluding to Deprive Us of Our Humanity.”

Senator Ted Cruz will give a speech entitled, “Bill of Rights, Liberty and Cancel Culture.”

“I got to say, Orlando is awesome! It’s not as nice as Cancun, but it’s nice!” Cruz said.

There will also be several talks on protecting our elections, as well as one titled “Winning Back America.”

Noem says her speech will also focus on the country.

“America is a special place and so I’ll reflect back on our history and talk about how we can preserve this country and the example that it is for the rest of the world, far into the future,” Noem said on Thursday.

Despite Noem’s high-profile stature among conservatives, and several out-of-state fundraisers, she has denied that she plans to run for a national office in 2024.

KELOLAND News also asked the governor’s office who was paying for Noem’s trip to Orlando this weekend. Her office says the money is not from state funds and she is not using the state plane for this travel.

South Dakota has never seen a governor travel in and out of the state as much as Noem and you’ll no doubt remember that your tax dollars pay for Noem’s security detail wherever she goes.

Multiple attempts to make the cost of Noem’s security, by the South Dakota Highway Patrol, public, failed in this year’s legislative session.

On Thursday, lawmakers rejected a bill – supported by the Governor – that would have paid for a new state airplane.","(KELO) — When former President Donald Trump gives his first speech since leaving office this weekend, Governor Kristi Noem will be there.

1 week ago,Pounding The Rock,LaMarcus Aldridge headlines Spurs trade rumors as the deadline approaches,"The 2021 NBA trade deadline is just under a month away on March 25, 2021, and that means the rumor mill is starting to churn. While the San Antonio Spurs aren’t known for making mid-season moves unless it’s requested by the player (a la Nando De Colo) or an offer too good to pass up comes along, they always do their due diligence.

However, this season might be different. The Spurs are facing a nearly unprecedented offseason that could potentially set the projection for the future of the franchise, with all four of their main veterans — LaMarcus Aldridge, DeMar DeRozan, Patty Mills, and Rudy Gay — hitting unrestricted free agency. They’re going to have decisions to make on all those players, and that could include seeing if there’s a trade market out there to get pieces in return instead of potentially losing them for nothing.

Headlining the trade rumor mill for the Spurs is unsurprisingly Aldridge: the oldest of the bunch and whose potential future with team — both this season and beyond — seems the most unsure. After missing the Bubble following shoulder surgery, he has missed nine games so far this season with knee and hip issues, and while his signature shot is still there, his mobility appears dramatically deteriorated. During his most recent six-game absence, the Spurs flourished with Jakob Poeltl taking over starting center duties, and in their return from a COVID hiatus (and LMA’s first game back), he came off the bench for the first time since his rookie season.

While he gracefully accepted the role and took it stride (and after the game Gregg Popovich seemed noncommittal on if it was a permanent move), it could be a sign that his days with the Spurs are numbered. It’s been known for much of the season that they have been open to listening to offers for Aldridge, and that was recently reinforced by ESPN’s Marc Spears on The Jump:

“Another name is San Antonio, is kind of surprising. LaMarcus Aldridge’s name has been bandied about.”

We're exactly a month away from the NBA trade deadline, so we went hot stove with @ZachLowe_NBA, @MarcJSpears and @RamonaShelburne to find out the most likely buyers, sellers and buyout candidates to look for over the next few weeks: pic.twitter.com/AMDJMsHkah — Rachel Nichols (@Rachel__Nichols) February 26, 2021

Spears also mentioned he’s heard DeRozan’s name “a little bit”, which again is not too surprising, but it will likely take a lot more to pry him away from San Antonio now than it would have before the season. Since the Bubble, he has flourished as a leader in a small-ball PF position alongside the younger Spurs, where his defensive deficiencies against less mobile players are more easily masked, and he has become their go-to guy in the clutch. (Anyone think he wasn’t missed in their recent loss to the Thunder?) He has not ruled out returning to the Spurs next season, and with there likely not being any other big name free agents looking to come to San Antonio, this season has proven he may be worth keeping around if the asking price isn’t too high.

As for their other veterans, Gay has been tied to recent reports regarding the Miami Heat, who are looking to add some veteran talent to a squad that is struggling after last season’s surprising Finals appearance. There haven’t been any serious rumors regarding Mills, and while one could see a title contender looking for a veteran with championship experience making an offer for him, it’s also easy to see the Spurs setting a high asking price. He’s still the spiritual leader of the group, their current sixth man, and could still have a role going forward.

As always, it’s important to take all trade rumors with a grain of salt (and especially check the source first), and as of now no one has been tied to any particular team besides Gay. With that being said, the next month should be interesting for the Spurs, who are caught in a complicated position of being well on their way to making the playoffs (and not wanting to be the first team in franchise history to miss the postseason in consecutive seasons) while also having to be wary of the future. At this point, both no move or any move would be unsurprising.","The 2021 NBA trade deadline is just under a month away on March 25, 2021, and that means the rumor mill is starting to churn.

Here’s that headline and some more you might have missed this week.

‘I lost all my babies.’ Woman devastated after fire destroys barn, kills animals

Terri Blodgett ran out of her house with no socks, shoes or coat on after a neighbor woke her up in the middle of the night, telling her that her barn was on fire.

She tried two barn doors to get inside to save her goats, chickens and pigs, but the heat and smoke drove her away. The back door was open, so she crawled into the barn.

“I kept reaching inside on my hands and knees trying to feel what I could feel, and I pulled out a 3-month-old goat, a little billy,” Blodgett said.

Its role in the Underground Railroad could earn Jackson train station national historic recognition

Jackson’s historic train station has long been credited for its role in developing the city’s economy.

But on Tuesday, Feb. 23, officials announced an effort to give the station national credit for its contribution to the Underground Railroad that helped Black slaves from the southern U.S. escape to freedom in the 19th century.

Jackson historians want to add the nearly 150-year-old Amtrak station to the National Park Service’s National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom. Approval of such a request and a marker to place at the station would highlight its significance in the anti-slavery movement, they said.

2021 NFL Draft: Pro day schedule

With the recent announcement that the 2021 NFL Scouting Combine will not be taking place, the NFL released the schedule of collegiate pro days for scouts to attend for the 2021 offseason. With no Combine, Pro Days will be the focus of the 2021 NFL Draft scouting season.

Brandon Scherff rumors: 5 best fits in NFL free agency

4. NEW YORK GIANTS: NFC East The NY Giants‘ offensive line very much remains a work in progress. There are legitimate questions about whether left guard Will Hernandez, and the organization’s second-round pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, is the long-term solution. Hernandez regressed dramatically under a new coaching staff and was ultimately benched in favor of fifth-round rookie Shane Lemieux. Lemieux finished the season with a 32.2 overall grade from Pro Football Focus and a 16.9 pass-blocking mark. Not ideal. Neither is the fact that Lemieux surrendered 25 pressures and five sacks in 299 pass-blocking snaps. The Giants are going to need to do something along the interior of the line, especially if Kevin Zeitler becomes a cap casualty due to his $14.5 million cap number in 2021. Should Scherff become available, he just might be the ideal replacement for Hernandez or Zeitler. The NY Giants, if Zeitler is released, could offer Scherff a healthy raise and the opportunity to play against the team that strung him along for the past two offseasons without signing him to a long-term contract …

Like Joe Thuney on Tuesday, Matt Lombardo describes how longtime NFC East rival guard Brandon Scherff would be a solid fit for the G-Men. At 29 years old, Scherff is not much younger than incumbent right guard Kevin Zeitler, and the Giants would likely need to cut Zeitler in order to make such a move at Scherff. But what do you think, Giants fans?

Daring moves for all 32 NFL teams in the 2021 offseason

New York Giants: Draft OT Rashawn Slater with the No. 11 pick The Giants expected to solve their long-term left tackle problem with their 2020 selection of Andrew Thomas with the No. 4 pick. But even allowing for some early struggles after veteran Nate Solder’s opt-out forced him into the Week 1 starting lineup, Thomas underwhelmed in his rookie season. His 5.8% blown block rate was the highest among tackles with 300 or more snaps in pass protection, according to Sports Info Solutions charting. That’s a major problem for young quarterback Daniel Jones, who, despite cutting his turnover rate in Year 2, tied for the league lead with 11 fumbles thanks in large part to a 9.1% sack rate that was second highest at his position. And it makes tackle Rashawn Slater the perfect choice for the team’s top 2021 draft pick, even if it opens the front office up to criticism from the media and fans that might read it as an admission of failure with Thomas. In truth, a Slater selection would not admit failure. His strength and athleticism will likely allow him to play multiple offensive line positions. But it would plan for the possibility of a failure that could derail the franchise given the necessary timing of a Jones extension. The Giants will have to decide on Jones’ fifth-year option next offseason, so they need to protect him this season to see if he can protect the football. Slater would provide insurance for the team to make that evaluation in 2021, and he may even be the difference between one bad lineman and two good ones if Thomas is a better fit for right tackle than left.

Under the title of “daring moves,” this one would certainly qualify. There is no denying that a player with Rashawn Slater’s positional flexibility (capable of playing all five offensive line spots) and sound mechanics would make him worthy of being the 11th overall pick. But with so many other pressing needs such as wide receiver and edge rusher that can be addressed at this spot as well, it is highly unlikely that the Giants draft Slater.

Giants sign veteran OL Jonotthan Harrison

A career backup with some game-time experience, Harrison’s signing gives the Giants more depth at the center position behind current starter Nick Gates.

State comptroller Tom DiNapoli just provided the strongest argument for a bold Open Culture program — jobs in the arts fell 61 percent last year during the pandemic (the Times and Gothamist covered DiNapoli’s report).

The sector “is a cornerstone of the city’s ability to attract businesses, residents and visitors alike,” said DiNapoli’s report [PDF]. “Yet the sector relies on audiences who gather to take part in shared experiences, and this way of life has been significantly disrupted by the pandemic.”

The report noted the existence of the city’s Open Culture program (the Times story didn’t), but it didn’t explain how vitally important it is: right now, as Streetsblog has reported, the city has set aside 105 short segments of roadway (some of them along existing Open Streets) for qualified arts groups to hold performances. But almost no one seems to know about the program (at a forum about the future design of the 34th Avenue open street on Wednesday night, for example, the existence of the Open Culture program came as a shock to virtual all attendees. Other open streets activists have said they’ve heard similar reactions, or non-reactions, at other public space events).

“There is a huge communications gap between DOT, the Street Activity Permit Office, and artists/arts organizations,” one arts insider told us.

It’s time for this program — which starts in days! — to become better known and supported, just as the mayor’s other car-free street programs (open streets and open restaurants) are supported.

Event: Big Ten Indoor Championships (Day 1 of 3)

U-M Result: 3rd of 13 teams (25 points)

Next U-M Event: Friday, Feb. 26 -- Big Ten Indoor Championships - Day Two (Geneva, Ohio), 3:30 p.m.

• Complete Results (PDF)

GENEVA, Ohio -- The University of Michigan women's track and field team captured a pair of silver-medal finishes to get things rolling on the first of three days at the Big Ten Indoor Championships on Thursday (Feb. 25) at the SPIRE Institute.

Ericka VanderLende was the runner-up at the 3,000-meter distance in one of the fastest times in school history, while the quartet of Alice Hill , Ziyah Holman , Lauren Fulcher and Katelynne Hart came within .07 seconds of getting the win in a distance medley relay that came right down to the wire.

VanderLende was not alone in her race, either; she was one of three Wolverines to finish top-eight -- along with fourth-place Kathryn House and seventh-place Samantha Tran -- to score points for the team. Also adding points to Michigan's column was seventh-place weight thrower Courtney Jacobsen .

All told, Michigan finished the opening day of competition with 25 points, good for third in the standings after four of 18 events scored. Only Minnesota with 37 and Nebraska with 26 are ahead of the Wolverines.

Sixty percent of those points came courtesy of VanderLende, House and Tran in the 3,000 meters. VanderLende battled and led Minnesota's Bethany Hasz for much of the race, but ultimately crossed second in 9:12.45, six seconds back. Only three women in school history have ever gone faster than VanderLende in this event.

House notched a significant 10.45-second improvement on her previous career best at this distance to place fourth in 9:21.31. Tran also took a big step forward with an 8.81-second gain on her previous best for seventh in 9:25.08. Teammate Kayla Windemuller came up just three seconds shy of the top eight, placing 10th in a career-best 9:28.01.

VanderLende notched eight points for the effort, House added five and Tran chipped in two more.

Michigan came within fractions of a second of defending its distance medley relay crown, but ultimately fell to Minnesota to settle for the silver medal in a time of 11:10.12. After Minnesota and Indiana opened up an early lead on the Wolverines, Holman ripped off one of her signature comebacks on the 400-meter leg to get Michigan right back into contention.

Fulcher kept the Wolverines right near the front over the course of her 800-meter leg before handing off to Hart for 1,600-meter anchor duties. Hart answered a move by Minnesota to the lead with less than 500 meters to go and swung wide coming off the final turn a lap later in an attempt to power past the Golden Gopher, but her finishing kick came up just .07 seconds shy of the gold.

Michigan earned eight points for the effort.

The remaining two points came courtesy of Jacobsen, who scored in the weight throw for the second-straight season. Jacobsen launched a 19.01m (62 feet, 4.5 inches) heave on her third of six attempts that ultimately held up for a top-eight finish.

The Wolverines nearly scored more points in the long jump, where Ameia Wilson finished ninth for the second time in as many years. Wilson leapt a career-best 5.77m (18-11.25) on her opening attempt, and it was enough by two centimeters to advance her to the nine-woman final.

1 week ago,mlive.com,Thriller in Three Rivers headlines Wednesday’s Kalamazoo-area prep hoops action,"KALAMAZOO, MI - After falling behind by 14 points in the first quarter of their third game in five days, it would’ve been easy for the Three Rivers boys basketball team to mail it on Wednesday against Paw Paw and look forward to having four days off.

But the Wildcats knew they’re better than that, and they put on a clinic in the second quarter to take a 28-25 halftime lead and hold on for a 59-51 win.

Senior forward Isaiah Moore led Three Rivers with 19 points, 12 rebounds and six assists, including 10 points in the fourth quarter.

The Wildcats sank 19 of 22 free throws for the game and all eight of their attempts in the fourth quarter to seal the victory, which was in stark contrast to Saturday’s 65-63 loss to Otsego, when they went 5 of 12 down the stretch and saw their lead slip away.

Sophomore Drew Brown scored six of his 10 points in a pivotal second quarter, when Three Rivers outscored Paw Paw 22-5.

The first quarter was almost as lopsided in Paw Paw’s favor, as the Red Wolves built a 20-6 lead behind a trio of 3-pointers from Finlay Tate, who tied for the team lead with 17 points in the game.

Fellow senior guard Mitchell Mason also scored 17, including nine in the third quarter to pull the Red Wolves to a 43-all tie heading into the fourth.

Caleb Bowen rounded out Paw Paw’s double-digit scorers with 12 points.

Three Rivers’ Angelo Hausmanis continued his promising freshman season with 14 points, including six in the third quarter to help his team stay neck-and-neck with the Red Wolves.

Even with last week’s narrow loss to Otsego, Three Rivers (5-2) has been playing some of its best basketball lately, and the Wildcats look to keep that going after some much-needed rest on Monday at Edwardsburg (4-0).

Paw Paw (5-3), which was playing its third game in six days, couldn’t quite capitalize on the momentum from Monday’s big win over Otsego, so the Red Wolves will look to rebound on Saturday at Fennville (5-2), which caps a string of five consecutive road games.

The thriller in Three Rivers was far from the only noteworthy basketball matchup from Wednesday, so follow along for more scores, stats and highlight from around Kalamazoo.

Sturgis’ Kurowski goes off for 33 in win over Vicksburg

Sturgis guard Thomas Kurowski continued his impressive senior season by scoring 33 points and dishing six assists in Wednesday’s 68-61 win over Vicksburg.

The 6-foot-4 future University of Chicago Maroon netted the 1,000th point of his career on Saturday and now has scored at least 30 points in three games this season.

Sturgis is also getting solid contributions from senior Bradyn Webb, who had 15 points on five 3-pointers against Vicksburg, and rising sophomore Jacob Thompson, so scored 12 against the Bulldogs.

The Trojans are back in action on Monday against Dowagiac.

MINNEAPOLIS, Minn. -- A total of five medal-winning swims -- including a third consecutive win in the 50-yard freestyle from junior Maggie MacNeil -- highlighted the efforts of the No. 9-ranked University of Michigan women's swimming and diving team on the second day of the Big Ten Championships on Wednesday (Feb. 24) at the Jean K. Freeman Aquatic Center. After two days, the Wolverines sit in second place (358.5 points). Ohio State leads the team race (526 points).

The Michigan sprinters provided the highlight of the night, as MacNeil (21.44) and senior Daria Pyshnenko (21.88) went 1-2 in the 50-yard freestyle for the second consecutive year. For MacNeil, it marked a third consecutive gold medal in the event, a feat achieved by only one other woman in program history (Jennie Eberwein, 1996-98). Not to be overlooked was Pyshnenko, who touched only .06 seconds off her career best and assuredly punched her ticket to the NCAA Championships next month.

Sophomore Kaitlynn Sims was one of two Wolverines in the 'A' final of the 500-yard freestyle, bringing back a silver medal (4:40.29). But one of the biggest jumps of the day belonged to junior Caroline Sisson , who qualified for her first 'A' final from the second heat of the morning's preliminaries. She finished seventh (4:45.23), a massive leap from two years ago when she was 20th in the same event. Senior Sierra Schmidt grabbed some points in the consolation final, finishing 12th (4:47.11). Sophomore Sophia Kudryashova had a nice drop out of the 'C' final, winning the heat and taking 17th overall (4:47.90).

Junior Olivia Carter won her second bronze medal in as many days, taking third in the 200-yard IM (1:56.32). Junior Victoria Kwan snuck into the 'A' final during the morning's preliminaries and moved up a spot in the evening, finishing seventh (1:58.37). Freshman Kathryn Ackerman added points to the team total, too, tying for 23rd (2:00.27).

The Wolverines wrapped up the evening with a bronze medal in the 400-yard medley relay, achieving an NCAA 'A' cut (3:29.84). MacNeil led off with the fastest backstroke split in the field (50.08), followed by sophomore Mariella Venter on breaststroke (1:00.88), Carter on butterfly (51.36, also the fastest split in the field) and Pyshnenko on freestyle (47.52).

Harden has been named an All-Star for the ninth straight year and Paul has earned his 11th All-Star selection.

The 70th NBA All-Star Game will be played Sunday, March 7 at State Farm Arena in Atlanta and televised by TNT as part of NBA All-Star 2021, which will take place on one night. TNT’s NBA All-Star coverage will begin at 5 p.m. ET with TNT NBA Tip-Off presented by CarMax, followed by the Taco Bell® Skills Challenge and MTN DEW® 3-Point Contest starting at 6:30 p.m. ET. NBA All-Star Game coverage will begin at 8 p.m. ET, with AT&T Slam Dunk taking place at halftime.

In addition to Harden, the NBA All-Star Game reserves selected from the Eastern Conference are Boston Celtics guard Jaylen Brown and forward Jayson Tatum, Chicago Bulls guard Zach LaVine, New York Knicks forward Julius Randle, Philadelphia 76ers guard Ben Simmons and Orlando Magic center Nikola Vučević.

Joining Paul as reserves from the Western Conference are Los Angeles Lakers forward Anthony Davis, LA Clippers forward Paul George, Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert and guard Donovan Mitchell, Portland Trail Blazers guard Damian Lillard and New Orleans Pelicans forward Zion Williamson.

Brown, LaVine and Randle from the Eastern Conference and Williamson from the Western Conference comprise the four first-time NBA All-Star selections among reserves.

In selecting the All-Star Game reserves, each NBA head coach voted for seven players in his conference – two guards, three frontcourt players and two additional players at any position. The head coaches were not permitted to vote for players from their own team.

The All-Star Game rosters will be determined through the NBA All-Star Draft, where team captains Kevin Durant of the Nets and LeBron James of the Lakers will select from the pool of players voted as starters and reserves in each conference. TNT will air the NBA All-Star Draft on Thursday, March 4 at 8 p.m. ET.

Durant and James will make their picks without regard to a player’s conference affiliation or position. Each captain will draft 11 players to complete a 12-player roster. The NBA All-Star Draft rules include:

• The eight players who, along with the two captains, are the starters will be drafted in the first round.

• The 14 players who are the reserves will be drafted in the second round.

• As the top overall vote-getter among fans, James will have the first pick in the first round (Starters). Durant will have the first pick in the second round (Reserves).

• The captains will alternate picks in each round until all players in that round have been selected.

The 10 All-Star Game starters, unveiled last week, were selected by fans, current NBA players and a media panel. The Eastern Conference starter pool is the Nets’ Durant and Kyrie Irving, the Milwaukee Bucks’ Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Washington Wizards’ Bradley Beal and the 76ers’ Joel Embiid. The Western Conference starter pool is the Lakers’ James, the Golden State Warriors’ Stephen Curry, the Dallas Mavericks’ Luka Dončić, the Denver Nuggets’ Nikola Jokić and the Clippers’ Kawhi Leonard.

NBA Commissioner Adam Silver will select the replacement for any player unable to participate in the All-Star Game, naming a player from the same conference as the player who is being replaced.

Philadelphia head coach Doc Rivers and his staff have earned the spot to coach Team Durant. Utah head coach Quin Snyder and his staff have earned the spot to coach Team LeBron.

Below is a closer look at the All-Star Game reserves and a complete list of this year’s All-Star selections

Women's basketball rankings: Texas A&M jumps to No. 2 in Week 14 of the Power 10

Every week throughout the 2020-21 season, the NCAA.com Starting Five will highlight the top women's basketball players in the country. Here are the standouts from the past week:

Kierstan Bell, FGCU

In a pair of wins over Jacksonville last week, Kierstan Bell of Florida Gulf Coast averaged 39 points, 13.5 rebounds, 2.5 blocks and 1.5 steals per game while shooting 32-for-50 (.640) from the field and 7-for-14 (.500) from 3-point range.

In Saturday's 89-64 victory, Bell scored a career-high 36 points with 12 rebounds, three steals and two blocks while making a single-game program record 15 field goals. Then, on Sunday, she poured in 42 points while adding 15 rebounds and three blocks to break FGCU's single-game scoring record and her own single-game field-goalx record from one day earlier. FGCU prevailed 87-58. Bell did all that in 63 total minutes, and her performance on Sunday came in just 30 minutes of action.

Bell now has three consecutive double-doubles and 14 double-doubles overall this year over 18 games. Her season total is tied for the third-most in a career in program history.

With her 78-point weekend, Bell is now among the top five in the country in scoring, passing Dyaisha Fair of Buffalo for fifth place on Sunday. The Wade Trophy watch list member is now averaging 25.2 points, 11.2 rebounds, 2.4 assists, 2.3 blocks and 1.6 steals per game this year. In Atlantic Sun Conference play, Bell is averaging 26.3 points, 10.9 rebounds, 2.3 assists, 1.8 blocks and 1.8 steals per game.

Bell's 25.2 PPG overall is on pace to be the fourth-best single-season offensive average in the conference's history. She's also on pace to have the most 3-point field goals made in a single season in ASUN history as she leads the conference in scoring and rebounding.

FGCU, 19-2 overall and 12-0 in ASUN play returns to action on Feb. 27 at home versus North Florida.

Rennia Davis, Tennessee

Tennessee forward Rennia Davis ran her string of 20-plus points games to three straight as the Lady Vols split a pair of games against nationally-ranked South Carolina and Georgia.

Davis averaged 23.0 points, 9.0 rebounds, 1.5 steals and 1.0 assists last week, posting back-to-back 20-point scoring efforts. The 6-foot-2 senior shot 44.8 percent from the field, including 44.4 percent on threes, and was 16 of 18 from the free-throw line for 88.9 percent in the two games.

Davis fired in a game-high 24 points and recorded her seventh double-double of the season with 12 rebounds as the Lady Vols beat the highest-ranked team since 2017 in the 75-67 defeat of the No. 2 Gamecocks. The victory snapped a 31-game Southeastern Conference winning streak by South Carolina. The double-double tied Davis for fourth all-time in school history, with her 36 career efforts matching Glory Johnson. Against South Carolina, Davis fired in all 24 of her points in the second half, going 6 of 8 from the field and 10 of 10 from the charity stripe as Tennessee erased deficits of 16 in the second quarter, 12 at the half and 15 in the third quarter. Davis posted 11 of her points in the final stanza, nearly outscoring the Gamecocks' 13 all by herself.

Against Georgia, Davis again led the Lady Vols charge, knocking down 23 and pulling down six boards in a tightly-contested game won by Georgia 57-55. Ten of her points came in the second half, with eight part of Tennessee’s fourth-quarter comeback that came up just short against perhaps the league's top defensive team.

Davis is now averaging 19.1 points and 9.3 rebounds per game in SEC play and 20.3 points and 11.8 rebounds per game against ranked teams after last week's contests.

The Lady Vols, 13-6 overall and 7-4 in SEC play are back in action on Thursday, as they travel to Missouri to face the Tigers.

Vivian Gray, Texas Tech

Texas Tech senior Vivian Gray had a career night in the Lady Raiders' overtime victory over Kansas on Saturday, scoring a career-high 38 points to go along with 10 rebounds, three blocks and three steals.

Gray had 21 points in the second half and five points in the overtime period to push Texas Tech to victory. Gray's 38-point double-double was the most points a player has had in a double-double in Big 12 Conference play this season. She is only the second player in the nation this season to record a game of 30-plus points, 10-plus rebounds, three-plus blocks and three-plus steals.

Gray's 38 points are tied for the third-most in a game by a Big 12 player this season. Gray's effort in the win helped the Lady Raiders to their second overtime win of the year and clinched the team's first Big 12 sweep of the season.

It marked Gray's eighth double-double of the year and her 11th 20-point game. The senior ranks top-10 in the Big 12 in scoring (19.7 points per game), rebounding (8.5 per game), field goal percentage (43.2) and blocks (37).

Gray and the Lady Raiders, 10-12 overall and 5-11 in Big 12 play will be back in action this week when they travel to Kansas State on Feb. 24.

Maddy Siegrist, Villanova

Villanova went 2-1 for the week as sophomore forward Maddy Siegrist averaged 24.3 points per game and 11.0 rebounds per contest while shooting .457 from the field (27-of-59).

On Feb. 16 in a 98-74 home win over Butler, Siegrist scored 24 points in 29 minutes of play. Playing their first game in two weeks, the Wildcats made 16 first-half three-point field goals and scored 67 points in the first half.

Desi-Rae Young, UNLV

Freshman center Desi-Rae Young led UNLV to a road sweep at San Diego State that increased the Lady Rebels' road win streak to seven games, which is tied for the seventh-longest in the nation.

Young averaged a double-double for the week with 16 points and 10.5 rebounds in the road sweep.

In the first game, an 80-65 victory on Feb. 15, Young scored 12 points and posted nine rebounds in just 22 minutes of action. She went 4-of-6 from the floor and 4-of-6 at the line in the 15-point game one victory.

In UNLV's 73-71 victory on Feb. 16, the Lady Rebels entered the fourth quarter down 57-49 when Young scored the first four points of the fourth quarter, and after a UNLV trey, added two more points to cap off a 9-0 spurt to give UNLV the lead back. The Lady Rebels would not trail again in the game. She tied her career-high with 20 points in the victory while picking up her fourth double-double of the year with 12 rebounds.

Young currently paces all Mountain West Conference freshmen in both points (12.0) and rebounds (6.5) per game.

1 week ago,The Rookie Wire,Hornets' LaMelo Ball makes headlines over Mike Conley Jr. taunt,"On Monday, LaMelo Ball shared the team-high in scoring with 21 points, seven rebounds and four assists to lead the Charlotte Hornets in a 132-110 loss to the Utah Jazz on the road.

Charlotte went toe to toe with the best team in the NBA until midway through the third quarter. With the Hornets up by 11 points, the Jazz went on a 62-29 run to close the game to improve to 25-6.

The Jazz, for the second time this season versus the Hornets, set a single-game franchise record with 28 made 3-pointers. Utah drained 15 in the second half and shot a blistering 50.9% from beyond the arc for the game.

While Ball produced his eighth 20-point game of the season, the third overall pick also made headlines for his taunt on Jazz guard Mike Conley Jr. With the Hornets and Jazz trading baskets in the second quarter, Ball had a message for Conley after scoring on him.

Ball certainly has shown no shyness this season as a rookie. His play to begin the year has him firmly atop the Rookie of the Year race and it appears as though it is his award to lose at this point. He has even put his name on the map among his older peers and hasn’t backed down from an opponent, Conley included.

In the end, though, the Jazz had the last laugh after going on a monster run to close out the game and seal the win. The Hornets are still learning how to close opponents and Monday’s result will serve as a great learning opportunity for the future.

1 week ago,ESPN,"Brooklyn Nets guard James Harden headlines Eastern Conference's All-Star reserves, while Utah Jazz send two to Western Conference roster","Bobby Marks reacts to the players selected as All-Star Game reserves and details some notable bonuses unlocked for those who made the team. (0:51)

The NBA announced the reserve selections for next month's All-Star Game in Atlanta on Tuesday night, a list headlined by Brooklyn Nets star James Harden as well as center Rudy Gobert and guard Donovan Mitchell from the league-leading Utah Jazz.

Harden, the NBA's Most Valuable Player in 2018, is representing Brooklyn for the first time in what will be his ninth consecutive All-Star appearance. The previous eight came with the Houston Rockets, who traded Harden to Brooklyn as part of a four-team deal last month. Since the trade, Harden has averaged 24.9 points and 11.4 assists in 18 games with Brooklyn. He will join teammates Kevin Durant -- one of two captains, alongside Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James -- and Kyrie Irving, both of whom were voted in as starters last week.

In addition to Harden, the six other selections from the Eastern Conference were: guard Jaylen Brown and forward Jayson Tatum from the Boston Celtics; New York Knicks forward Julius Randle; Chicago Bulls guard Zach LaVine; Philadelphia 76ers guard Ben Simmons; and Orlando Magic center Nikola Vucevic.

Brown, the front-runner for the NBA's Most Improved Player Award this season, is averaging career highs across the board for the Celtics, including points (25.5), assists (3.9) and all three shooting percentage categories: field goal (49.7), 3-point (40.9) and free throw (76.6), helping him earn his first All-Star selection. Tatum, meanwhile, is averaging a career-high 26.4 points, and is making his second straight appearance in the league's midseason showcase.

Vucevic will make his second All-Star appearance, having made his first two seasons ago, and is averaging a career-high 24.1 points per game and shooting a career-best 40% from 3-point range. Simmons will make his third consecutive All-Star appearance; the well-rounded guard is, alongside starter Joel Embiid, a huge reason the Sixers entered Tuesday with the Eastern Conference's best record.

They will be joined by two first-time All-Stars from two of the league's flagship franchises in Randle and LaVine, both of whom are having career years. Randle, who has helped lead the 15-16 Knicks into surprising contention for a playoff berth, is averaging career bests in virtually every category playing under Tom Thibodeau, while LaVine is averaging career highs of 28.6 points, 5.4 rebounds and 5.1 assists.

Over the past few weeks, there has been intense debate over who would merit the final couple of spots in the East, with a deep pool of candidates garnering support. Ultimately, though, the league's coaches wound up leaving off several of them, including: Miami Heat center Bam Adebayo and forward Jimmy Butler; Milwaukee Bucks forward Khris Middleton; 76ers forward Tobias Harris; Toronto Raptors guard Fred VanVleet; Indiana Pacers guard Malcolm Brogdon and forward Domantas Sabonis; Atlanta Hawks guard Trae Young; and Charlotte Hornets forward Gordon Hayward.

Out West, Gobert and Mitchell were the headliners, as they were the two representatives for the streaking Jazz, who go into Wednesday's showdown versus the Lakers on ESPN with the NBA's best record, and having won 20 of their past 22 games. Gobert, who is positioned to win his third Defensive Player of the Year award, makes his second straight All-Star appearance this season after a couple of near misses in previous seasons. It also is the second straight appearance for Mitchell, who is averaging career highs of 24.5 points and 5.2 assists this season.

They were joined by: Portland Trail Blazers guard Damian Lillard; LA Clippers forward Paul George; Lakers forward Anthony Davis; Phoenix Suns guard Chris Paul and New Orleans Pelicans forward Zion Williamson.

Lillard easily could've been a starter, as he's having another stellar season, averaging 29.8 points and 7.7 assists and keeping Portland in the playoff picture even though guard CJ McCollum and center Jusuf Nurkic are out with long-term injuries. George, meanwhile, is back in the All-Star Game for the seventh time after missing it last year, his first in Los Angeles, after injuries delayed the start of his season. Davis, on the other hand, is all but certain to be replaced by someone ahead of the All-Star Game because of the calf strain that currently has the Lakers star sidelined.

The final two spots out West went to one of the league's oldest stars in Paul and one of its youngest in Williamson. Paul, whom Phoenix acquired before the season, makes his 11th All-Star appearance and his second in a row after making the roster last year for Oklahoma City. Williamson, the top overall pick in the 2019 NBA draft, makes his first appearance after averaging 25.1 points and shooting over 60% from the field.

Those two beat out a field of candidates for the final couple of spots that included: San Antonio Spurs forward DeMar DeRozan; Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander; Jazz guard Mike Conley, who continues to hold the unofficial title of best player never to make an All-Star team; Suns guard Devin Booker; and Pelicans forward Brandon Ingram.

Like in recent seasons, the NBA will combine the All-Stars into one pool, which will be divided into two teams by captains James and Durant. Jazz coach Quin Snyder will coach James' team, while Sixers coach Doc Rivers will helm Durant's squad.

The game will also, like last year, feature the Elam Ending, in which the teams play to a final score as opposed to a timed fourth quarter. Like last year, that final score will be determined by taking the combined score of the team that's ahead through three quarters and adding 24 points -- in honor of Kobe Bryant -- to that total.","Bobby Marks reacts to the players selected as All-Star Game reserves and details some notable bonuses unlocked for those who made the team.

Dangote takeover latest

African billionaire Aliko Dangote has previously made his desire to takeover from Stan Kroenke at Arsenal extremely clear and a push to change ownership could occur this year.

Dangote has stated on a number of occasions that he'll switch his attention towards purchasing the Gunners when his oil refinery being built in Nigeria is completed.

According to The Africa Report, the refinery is set to be operational in ""early 2021"", meaning Dangote could start talks with Kroenke over a takeover in north London.

Dangote, Africa's richest man, first expressed a desire for a takeover in 2015 and, five years later, there could now be movement.

Junior Firpo opportunity

Hector Bellerin could leave Arsenal at the end of the season, with Paris Saint-Germain ready to reignite their interest in the Spaniard and Barcelona holding a long-term interest in the 25-year-old.

Interest from the former could hand the Gunners an opportunity to sign Junior Firpo, following an unsuccessful loan swoop that was reported on deadline day in January.

Firpo has found opportunities limited in Catalonia and may be open to a switch to north London, which may give Arsenal the chance to utilise Bellerin as makeweight.

Capable of playing on both both sides as a full-back as well as in the heart of defence and in left midfield, Firpo's versatility would be a huge asset for Mikel Arteta.

Merson issues Arsenal prediction

Arsenal legend Paul Merson has issued his prediction for the final months of the Premier League and believes the Gunners have a lot of rebuilding work ahead of them, outlining the importance of the Europa League campaign.

""It's probably now time to focus on the Europa League for Arsenal, but they'd do well to win that with the way things are going. There are some really good teams in that competition - some good English teams as well,"" he told Sky Sports.

""It's a real massive rebuild job at the Emirates Stadium and I think it's going to take a long, long time. That's unless they've got some money from somewhere and they have a right go, but we've seen Chelsea have a right go and look where they are.

""We are talking about whether they will get in the top four and that was a lot of money, so there are no guarantees. It's a really hard one to take for Arsenal at the moment.""","Dangote takeover latestAfrican billionaire Aliko Dangote has previously made his desire to takeover from Stan Kroenke at Arsenal extremely clear and a push to change ownership could occur this year.

1 week ago,A Sea of Blue,Tuesday Headlines: Grant Bingham Edition,"Kentucky has had some luck with in-state offensive lineman in recent years, and Kentucky is hoping to continue that success with one of the top prospects in the state in the Class of 2022.

Grant Bingham is a four-star prospect out of Johnson Central High School in Paintsville, Kentucky. At 6’6 and more than 300 pounds, Bingham already has the look of an offensive lineman at the next level, and Kentucky is hoping that he will wear the blue and white when he plays in college.

Bingham is receiving interest from top programs like Ohio State, Notre Dame, Oregon, Alabama, and others, but Kentucky is one of the schools recruiting him the hardest, as he plays just two hours from UK.

Bingham recently talked to KSR about his recruitment and what he’s looking for, along with touching on a recent meeting he had with the UK coaches. Bingham said he won’t be making a decision until his senior season in the fall.

It seems like new offensive line coach Eric Wolford is doing a good job building a relationship that was established by John Schlarman.
